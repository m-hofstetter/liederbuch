\begin{song}{Lemon Tree}{Fools Garden}{}
[Am]I'm Sitting Here I[Em]n A Boring Room
[Am]It's Just Another Rainy Sunday [Em]Afternoon
[Am]I'm Wasting My Time I Got [Em]Nothing To Do
[Am]I'm Hanging Around I'm [Em]Waiting For You
[Dm]But Nothing Ever Happens - A[Em]nd I Won[Am]der

[Am]I'm Driving Around[Em] In My Car
[Am]I'm Driving Too Fast I'm Drivin[Em]g Too Far
[Am]I'd Like To Change My Poin[Em]t Of View
[Am]I Feel So Lonely I'm Waiti[Em]ng For You
[Dm]But Nothing Ever Happens - A[Em]nd I Won[Am]der

\gSec{Chorus}
[C]I Wonder How I [G]Wonder Why [Am]Yesterday You Told Me 'bout The [Em]Blue Blue Sky
[F]And All That I Can Se[G]e Is Just A Yellow Le[C]mon-tree[G]{\hh}
[C]I'm Turning My Head [G]Up And Down [Am]I'm Turning Turning Turning Turning [Em]Turning Around
[F]And All That I Can Se[D]e Is Just A Yellow Lem[G]on Tree

[Am]I'm Sitting Here I [Em]Miss The Power
[Am]I'd Like To Go Out Taking A Sho[Em]wer
[Am]But There's A Heavy Cloud [Em]Inside My Head
[Am]I Feel So Tired Put Myself[Em] Into Bed
[D#m]Where [Dm]Nothing Ever Happens [Em]- And I [Am]Wonder

[E]Isolation - I[Am]s Not Good For Me
[G]Isolation - I[C] Don't Want To S[E]it On A Lemon-tree
[Am]I'm Steppin' Aroun[Em]d In A Desert Of Joy
[Am]Baby Anyhow I'll G[Em]et Another Toy
[Dm]And Everything Will Hap[Em]pen - And You'll Wonder[Am]{\hh}

\gSec{Chorus}
[C]I Wonder How I [G]Wonder Why [Am]Yesterday You Told Me 'bout The [Em]Blue Blue Sky
[F]And All That I Can Se[G]e Is Just A Yellow Le[C]mon-tree[G]{\hh}
[C]I'm Turning My Head [G]Up And Down [Am]I'm Turning Turning Turning Turning [Em]Turning Around
A[F]nd All That I Can See[D] Is Just A Yell[G]ow Lemon-tree A[G]nd I wonder I wonder

[C]I Wonder How I [G]Wonder Why Y[Am]esterday You Told Me 'bout The B[Em]lue Blue Sky
A[F]nd All That I Can See[G],\hh A[F]nd All That I Can See[G],\hh A[F]nd All That I Can See[G]{\hh}
Is Just A Yellow Le[C]mo[F]n-tree[C].
