\gSec{Intro}
I wanna [Em]take you somewhere so you [C]know I [Em]care,
but it's so [Bm]cold and I don't know [C]where
I brought you [Em]daffodils, on a [C]pretty st[Em]ring,
but they won't [Bm]flower like they did last [C]spring
And I wanna [Em]kiss you, make you [C]feel al[Em]right,
but I'm just so [Bm]tired to share my [C]nights

I wanna [Em]cry and I [C]wanna l[Em]ove, but all my [Bm]tears have been used [C]up

\gSec{Chorus}
On another love[G], another love[Em]{\h}
All my [Bm]tears have been used [C]up, on another love[G], another [Em]love
All my [Bm]tears have been used [C]up, on another [G]love, another love[Em]{\h}
All my [Bm]tears have been used [C]uuuhuuuh[G]uuup
[Em]Oooh[Bm]oooh[C]{\h}

And if somebody [Em]hurts you yeah I [C]wanna [Em]fight,
but my hands been [Bm]broken one too many [C]times
So I use my [Em]voice, Ill be so [C]fucking [Em]rude
Words they always [Bm]win, but I know Ill l[C]ose
And Id sing a [Em]song that would [C]be just [Em]ours,
but I sang them [Bm]all to another [C]heart

And I wanna [Em]cry I wanna [C]learn to [Em]love, but all my [Bm]tears have been used [C]up

\gSec{Chorus}
On another love,[G] another love[Em]{\h}
All my [Bm]tears have been used [C]up, on another love[G], another love[Em]{\h}
All my [Bm]tears have been used [C]up, on another love[G], another love[Em]{\h}
All my [Bm]tears have been used [C]uuuhuuuh[G]uuup ah
[Em]Oooh[Bm]oooh[C]{\h}

I wanna sing a [Em]song that would [C]be just [Em]ours,
but I sang them [Bm]all to another [C]heart
And I wanna [Em]cry I wanna [C]fall in [Em]love,
but all my [Bm]tears have been used [C]up

\gSec{Chorus}
