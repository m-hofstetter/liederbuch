\begin{song}{Rose Tattoo}{Dropkick Murphys}{}
[Am]The pictures tell the story, this [C]life has many shades
[G]I’d wake up every morning and b[Am]efore I’d start each day
I’d [Am]take a drag from last nights cigarette that [C]smoldered in it’s tray
[G]Down a little something and t[Dm]hen be on my way[Am]{\hh}

[Am]I traveled far and wide and [C]laid this head in many ports
I was [G]guided by a compass, I saw [Am]beauty to the north
[Am]I drew the tales of many lives and wore the f[C]aces of my own
I had these mem[G]ories all around me, so I [Dm]wouldn’t be alone

[C]Some may be from showing up, [G]others are from growing up
[Dm]Sometimes I was so messed up and [Am]didn’t have a clue
I ain’t [C]winning no one over, I [G]wear it just for you
[Dm]I’ve got your name written here in a rose tat[Am]too

\gSec{Chorus}
[Am]In a rose tattoo, in a [C]rose tattoo
I’ve got your [Dm]name written here in a rose t[G]att[Am]oo

[Am]This ones for the mighty sea, [C]mischief, gold and piracy
[G]This ones for the man that raised me, [Am]taught me sacrifice and bravery
[Am]This ones for our favorite game, [C]black and gold, we wave the flag
[G]This ones for my family name, with p[Dm]ride I wear it to the grave

[C]Some may be from showing up, [G]others are from growing up
[Dm]Sometimes I was so messed up and [Am]didn’t have a clue
I ain’t [C]winning no one over, I [G]wear it just for you
[Dm]I’ve got your name written here in a rose tat[Am]too

\gSec{Chorus}
[Am]In a rose tattoo, in a [C]rose tattoo
I’ve got your [Dm]name written here in a rose t[G]att[Am]oo
[Am]In a rose tattoo, in a [C]rose tattoo
I’ve got your [Dm]name written here in a [N.C.]rose tatt[Am]oo

[Am]You’ll always be there with me, [C]even if you’re gone
You’ll [G]always have my love, our [Dm]memory will live on

[C]Some may be from showing up, [G]others are from growing up
[Dm]Sometimes I was so messed up and [Am]didn’t have a clue
I ain’t [C]winning no one over, I [G]wear it just for you
[Dm]I’ve got your name written here in a rose tat[Am]too
