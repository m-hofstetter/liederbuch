\begin{song}{All Star}{Smash Mouth}{}        
Some[G]body once [D]told me the [Am]world is gonna [C]roll me
I [G]ain't the sharpest [D]tool in the [Am]shed[C]{\h}
She was [G]looking kinda [D]dumb with her [Am]finger and her
[C]Thumb in the [G]shape of an [D]{L} on her [Am]forehead[C]{\h}

Well the [G]years start coming and they [D]don't stop coming
[Am]Fed to the rules and I [C]hit the ground running
[G]Didn't make sense not to [D]live for fun
Your [Am]brain gets smart but your [C]head gets dumb

[G]So much to do [D]so much to see
So what's [Am]wrong with taking the [C]back streets
You'll [G]never know if you don't [D]go
You'll [Am]never shine if you don't [C]glow

\gSec{Chorus}
[G]Hey now you're an [C]All Star get your [C#m]game on, go[C] play
[G]Hey now you're a [C]Rock Star get the [C#m]show on get[C] paid
And [G]all that [C]glitters is [C#m]gold
[C]Only shooting [G]stars [F]break the [C]mold

It's a [G]cool place and they [D]say it gets colder
You're [Am]bundled up now but wait '[C]til you get older
But the [G]meteor men beg to [D]differ
Judging by the [Am]hole in the satellite [C]picture

The ice we [G]skate is getting pretty [D]thin
The waters getting [Am]warm so you might as well [C]swim
My world's on [G]fire how about [D]yours
That's the way I [Am]like it and I never get [C]bored

\gSec{Chorus}
[G]Hey now you're an [C]All Star get your [C#m]game on, go[C] play
[G]Hey now you're a [C]Rock Star get the [C#m]show on get[C] paid
[G]all that [C]glitters is [C#m]gold
[C]Only shooting [G]stars [F]break the [C]mold
[G]Hey now you're an [C]All Star get your [C#m]game on, go[C] play
[G]Hey now you're a [C]Rock Star get the [C#m]show on get[C] paid
And a[G]ll that [C]glitters is [C#m]gold
[C]Only shooting [G]stars[F]{\h}

\pagebreak
Some[G]body once [D]asked, could I [Am]spare some change for [C]gas
I need to [G]get myself a[D]way from this [Am]place[C]{\h}
I said [G]yep what a con[D]cept I could [Am]use a little fuel my[C]self
And we could [G]all use a [D]little [Am]change[C]{\h}

Well the [G]years start coming and they [D]don't stop coming
[Am]Fed to the rules and I [C]hit the ground running
[G]Didn't make sense not to [D]live for fun
Your [Am]brain gets smart but your [C]head gets dumb

[G]So much to do [D]so much to see
So what's [Am]wrong with taking the [C]back streets
You'll [G]never know if you don't [D]go, go
You'll [Am]never shine if you don't [C]glow

\gSec{Chorus}
[G]Hey now you're an [C]All Star get your [C#m]game on, go[C] play
[G]Hey now you're a [C]Rock Star get the [C#m]show on get[C] paid
And [G]all that [C]glitters is [C#m]gold
[C]Only shooting [G]stars [F]break the [C]mold
And [G]all that [C]glitters is [C#m]gold
[C]Only shooting [G]stars [F]break the [C]mold
