\begin{song}{In the Summertime}{Mungo Jerry}{}
In the [D]summertime, when the weather is high,
[]you can stretch right up and touch the sky,
when the [G]weather's fine, you got women, you got women on your [D]mind.
Have a [A]drink, have a drive,
[G]go out and see what you can [D]find.

If her [D]daddy's rich, take her out for a meal,
[]if her daddy's poor, just do what you feel.
Speed a[G]long the lane, do a ton or a ton and twenty-[D]five.
When the [A]sun goes down,
you can [G]make it make it good in a lay-[D]by.

We're not [D]bad people, we're not dirty, we're not mean,
[]we love everybody but we do as we please.
When the [G]weather's fine, we go fishing or go sailing in the [D]sea.
We're always [A]happy,
life's for [G]living, yeah, that's our philoso[D]phy.

When the [D]winter's here, yeah, it's party time,
[]bring a bottle, wear your bright clothes, it'll soon be summertime.
And we'll [G]sing again, we'll go driving or maybe we'll settle [D]down.
If she's [A]rich, if she's nice,
bring your [G]friends and we'll all go into [D]town.

In the [D]summertime, when the weather is high,
[]you can stretch right up and touch the sky,
when the [G]weather's fine, you got women, you got women on your [D]mind.
Have a [A]drink, have a drive,
[G]go out and see what you can [D]find

If her [D]daddy's rich, take her out for a meal,
[]if her daddy's poor, just do what you feel.
Speed a[G]long the lane, do a ton or a ton and twenty-[D]five.
When the [A]sun goes down,
you can [G]make it, make it good in a lay-[D]by.

We're not [D]bad people, we're not dirty, we're not mean,
