\begin{song}{Eye of the Tiger}{Survivor}{}
[Am]Risin' up, ba[F]ck on the street,
[G]Did my time, took my [Am]chances.
[Am]Went the distance, now I'm ba[F]ck on my feet,
Just a m[G]an and his will to sur[Am]vive.

[Am]So many times, it [F]happens too fast,
[G]You change your passion for [Am]glory
[Am]Don't lose your grip on the [F]dreams of the past,
You must f[G]ight just to keep them al[Am]ive:

\gSec{Chorus}
[G]It's [Am]the [Dm]eye of the tiger, it's the t[C]hrill of the fig[G]ht -
Rising [Dm]up to the challenge of our [Am]ri - [G]val.
And the l[Dm]ast known survivor stalks his p[C]rey in the nig[G]ht,
And he's w[Dm]atching us a[Em7]ll with the e[F]ye [N.C.]of the t[Am]iger.

[Am]Face to face, ou[F]t in the heat,
[G]Hangin' tough, stayin' [Am]hungry.
[Am]They stack the odds, still we t[F]ake to the street,
For we k[G]ill with the skill to [Am]survive.

\gSec{Chorus}
[G]It's [Am]the [Dm]eye of the tiger, it's the t[C]hrill of the fig[G]ht -
Rising [Dm]up to the challenge of our [Am]ri - [G]val.
And the l[Dm]ast known survivor stalks his p[C]rey in the nig[G]ht,
And he's w[Dm]atching us a[Em7]ll with the e[F]ye [N.C.]of the t[Am]iger.

[Am]Risin' up, strai[F]ght to the top,
[G]Had the guts, got the g[Am]lory.
[Am]Went the distance, now I'm not [F]gonna stop,
Just a m[G]an and his will to sur[Am]vive.

\gSec{Chorus}
[G]It's [Am]the [Dm]eye of the tiger, it's the t[C]hrill of the fig[G]ht -
Rising [Dm]up to the challenge of our [Am]ri - [G]val.
And the l[Dm]ast known survivor stalks his p[C]rey in the nig[G]ht,
And he's w[Dm]atching us a[Em7]ll with the e[F]ye [N.C.]of the t[Am]iger.
