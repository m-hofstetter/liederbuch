\begin{song}[2]{Que Sera, Sera}{Doris Day}{}
When I was [G]just a little girl
I asked my mother, what will I [Am]be
[D]Will I be pretty, will I be rich
[D7]Here's what she said to [G]me. [G7]{\h}

\gSec{Chorus}
Que Se[C]ra, Sera,
Whatever will [G]be, will be
The future's not [D]ours, to see[D7]{\hh}
Que Sera, Se[G]ra[D]{\hh}
What will [D7]be, will [G]be.

When I grew[G] up and fell in love
I asked my sweetheart what lies a[Am]head
[D]Will we have rainbows, day after day
[D7]Here's what my sweetheart [G]said. [G7]{\h}

\gSec{Chorus}
Que Se[C]ra, Sera,
Whatever will [G]be, will be
The future's not [D]ours, to see[D7]{\hh}
Que Sera, Se[G]ra[D]{\hh}
What will [D7]be, will [G]be.

Now I have [G]children of my own
They ask their mother, what will I [Am]be
[D]Will I be handsome, will I be rich
[D7]I tell them tender[G]ly. [G7]{\h}

\gSec{Chorus}
Que Se[C]ra, Sera,
Whatever will [G]be, will be
The future's not [D]ours, to see[D7]{\hh}
Que Sera, Se[G]ra[D]{\hh}
What will [D7]be, will [G]be.
