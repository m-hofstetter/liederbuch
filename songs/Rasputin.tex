\begin{song}[2]{Rasputin}{Boney M.}{}
[Am]\hh[E]\hh[Am]\hh[E]\hh
There [Am]lived a certain man in Russia long ago
He was [Dm]big and strong, in his [E]eyes a flaming [Am]glow
[]Most people looked at him with terror and with fear
But to [Dm]Moscow chicks he was [E]such a lovely [Am]dear
[]He could preach the bible like a preacher, [Dm]full of ecstasy and [E]fire
[Am]But he also was the kind of teacher, [Dm]women w[E]ould [Am]desire

\gSec{Chorus}
[A]Ra Ra [C]Rasputin, [D]lover of the [A]Russian queen, [G]there was a [D]cat that [A]really was gone
Ra Ra [C]Rasputin, [D]Russia's greatest [A]love machine, [G]it was a [D]shame how [A]he carried on

[Am]\hh[E]\hh[Am]\hh[E]\hh[Am]\hh[Dm]\hh[E]\hh[Am]\hh
He [Am]ruled the Russian land and never mind the Tsar
But the [Dm]kasatschok he danced [E]really wunde[Am]rbar
[]In all affairs of state he was the man to please
But he was [Dm]real great when he [E]had a girl to[Am] squeeze
[]For the queen he was no wheeler dealer, [Dm]though she'd heard the things he'd [E]done
[Am]She believed he was a holy healer, [Dm]who would [E]heal her [Am]son

\gSec{Chorus}
[A]Ra Ra [C]Rasputin, [D]lover of the [A]Russian queen, [G]there was a [D]cat that [A]really was gone
Ra Ra[C] Rasputin,[D] Russia's greatest[A] love machine, [G]it was a [D]shame how [A]he carried on

\sprache{But when his drinking and lusting and his hunger for power became known to more and more people,
the demands to do something about this outrageous man became louder and louder.}

``This [Am]man's just got to go'', declared his enemies
But the [Dm]ladies begged, ``Don't you [E]try to do it,[Am] please''
[]No doubt this Rasputin had lots of hidden charms
Though he [Dm]was a brute they just [E]fell into his[Am] arms
[]Then one night some men of high standing [Dm]set a trap - they're not to [E]blame
[Am]``Come to visit us'', they kept demanding [Dm]and he [E]really [Am]came

\gSec{Chorus}
[A]Ra Ra [C]Rasputin, [D]lover of the [A]Russian queen, [G]they put some [D]poison [A]into his wine
Ra Ra [C]Rasputin, [D]Russia's greatest [A]love machine, [G]he drank it [D]all and [A]said, ``I feel fine''

[A]Ra Ra [C]Rasputin, [D]lover of the [A]Russian queen, [G]they didn't [D]quit, they [A]wanted his head
Ra Ra [C]Rasputin, [D]Russia's greatest [A]love machine, [G]and so they [D]shot him [A]till he was dead
