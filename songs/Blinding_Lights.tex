I've been tryna [Dm]call
I've been on my [Am]own for long enough
Maybe you can [C]show me how to love, may[G]be
I'm going through with[Dm]drawals
You don't even [Am]have to do too much
You can turn me [C]on with just a touch, ba[G]by

I look around and, [Dm]Sin City's cold and empty ([Am]oh), no one's around to judge me ([C]oh)
I can't see clearly when you're [N.C.]gone

\gSec{Chorus}
I said, [Dm]ooh, I'm [Am]blinded by the lights
No [C]I can't sleep until I feel your[G] touch
I said, [Dm]ooh, I'm [Am]drowning in the night
Oh [C]when I'm like this, you're the one I[G] trust (hey, hey, hey)

[Dm] \hh [Am] \hh [C] \hh [G] \hh
I'm running out of [Dm]time, 'cause I can see the [Am]sun light up the sky
So I hit the [C]road in overdrive, ba[G]by, oh-oh oh-oh oh

[Dm]The city's cold and empty ([Am]oh), no one's around to judge me ([C]oh)
I can't see clearly when you're [N.C.]gone

\gSec{Chorus}
I said, [Dm]ooh, I'm [Am]blinded by the lights
No [C]I can't sleep until I feel your[G] touch
I said, [Dm]ooh, I'm [Am]drowning in the night
Oh [C]when I'm like this, you're the one I[G] trust

I'm just walking [Dm]by to let you know (by to let you know)
I can never [Am]say it on the phone (say it on the phone)
Will [C]never let you go this t[G]ime (ooh)

\gSec{Chorus}
I said, [Dm]ooh, I'm [Am]blinded by the lights
No [C]I can't sleep until I feel your[G] touch, hey, hey, hey [Dm]\h [Am]\h [C]\h [G]\h 
Hey, hey, hey [Dm]\h [Am]\h [C]\h [G]\h 

I said, [Dm]ooh, I'm [Am]blinded by the lights
No [C]I can't sleep until I feel your[G] touch
