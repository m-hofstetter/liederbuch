\begin{song}[5]{Grenade}{Bruno Mars}{}
[Am]Easy come, easy go, that's just how you live, oh, [Em]take, take, take it all, but you never give.
[Am]Should've known you was trouble from the first kiss, had your [Em]eyes wide open.
[E7]Why [N.C.]were they open?

[Am]Gave you all I had and you tossed it in the trash, you t[Em]ossed it in the trash, you did.
To g[Am]ive me all your love is all I ever asked, 'cause [F]what you don't [E]unders[N.C.]tand is

\gSec{Chorus}
I'd catch a gren[Am]ade for ya [F]yeah,[C] yeah
Throw my [G]hand on a [Am]blade for ya [F]yeah,[C] yeah
I'd jump in [G]front of a tr[Am]ain for ya [F]yeah,[C] yeah
You know I'd [G]do anyth[Am]ing for ya [F]yeah,[C] yeah
Oh, [G]oh, I would [F]go through all this[G] pain,
Take a [C]bullet straight [E]through my b[Am]rain!
[G]Yes, I would die[F] for ya, baby,[E]{\h}
[N.C.]But you won't do the same.

[Am]Black, black, black and blue, beat me 'til I'm numb,
Tell the d[Em]evil I said ``hey'' when you get back to where you're from.
[Am]Mad woman, bad woman, that's just what you are,
Yeah, you'll sm[Em]ile in my face then rip the br[E7]akes [N.C.]out my car

[Am]Gave you all I had and you tossed it in the trash, you t[Em]ossed it in the trash, you did.
To g[Am]ive me all your love is all I ever asked, 'cause [F]what you don't [E]unders[N.C.]tand is

\gSec{Chorus}
I'd catch a gren[Am]ade for ya [F]yeah,[C] yeah
Throw my [G]hand on a [Am]blade for ya [F]yeah,[C] yeah
I'd jump in [G]front of a tr[Am]ain for ya [F]yeah,[C] yeah
You know I'd [G]do anyth[Am]ing for ya [F]yeah,[C] yeah
Oh, [G]oh, I would [F]go through all this[G] pain,
Take a [C]bullet straight [E]through my b[Am]rain!
[G]Yes, I would die[F] for ya, baby,[E]{\h}
[N.C.]But you won't do the same.

[Dm]If my body was on fire,
[Am]Ooh, you'd watch me burn down in flames.
[Dm]You said you loved me, you're a liar,
'cause you n[E]ever, ever, ever did, baby!
