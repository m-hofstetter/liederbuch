[Em]Once I was seven years o[G]ld, my momma told [C]me
go make yourself some friends or you'll be [D]lonely
[Em]Once I was seven years [G]old[C]{}

[Em]It was a big b[D]ig w[G]orld, but we thought we were bigger
[C]Pushing each other to the limits, we were l[D]earning quicker
[Em]By eleven [D]smoking [G]herb and drinking burning liquor
[C]Never rich so we were out to make that [D]steady figure

\gSec{Chorus}
[Em]Once I was eleven [D]years [G]old, my daddy told [C]me
go get yourself a wife or you'll be [D]lonely
[Em]Once I was eleven [D]years [G]old[C]{}

[Em]I always have [D]that [G]dream like my Daddy before me
[C]So I started writing songs, I started [D]writing stories
[Em]Something about that [D]glo[G]ry just always seemed to bore me
[C]Cause only those I really love will ever [D]really know me

\gSec{Chorus}
[Em]Once I was twenty [D]years [G]old, my story got [C]told
before the morning sun, when life was [D]lonely
[Em]Once I was twenty [D]years [G]old[C]{}

[Em]I only see [D]my [G]goals, I don't believe in failure
[C]Cause I know the smallest voices, they can [D]make it major
[Em]I got my boys [D]with[G] me at least those in favor
[C]And if we don't meet before I leave, I hope I [D]see you later

\gSec{Chorus}
[Em]Soon we'll be 30 [D]years [G]old, our songs have been [C]sold
we've traveled around the world  and we're still [D]roaming
[Em]Soon we'll be 30 [D]years [G]old[C]{}

[Em]I'm still learning about life, [G]my woman brought children for me
[C]So I can sing them all my songs and I can [D]tell them stories
[Em]Most of my boys are with me [G]some are still out seeking glory
[C]And some I had to leave behind my brother, [G]I'm still sorry

\gSec{Chorus}
[Em]Soon I'll be sixty [D]years [G]old - Will I think the world is [C]cold
or will I have a lot of children, who can [D]warm me?
[Em]Soon I'll be sixty [D]years [G]old[C]{}

[Em]Once I was seven [D]years [G]old
