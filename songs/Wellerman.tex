\begin{song}[3]{Wellerman}{Traditionell}{}
The[Am]re once was a ship that put to sea and the n[Dm]ame of the ship was the [Am]Billy o' Tea
The w[Am]inds blew hard, her bow dipped down. B[E]low, me bully boys, b[Am]low

\gSec{Chorus}
S[F]oon may the W[C]ellerman come to b[Dm]ring us sugar and [Am]tea and rum
[F]One day, when the t[C]onguin’ is done, we’ll t[E]ake our leave and [Am]go

She [Am]had not been two weeks from shore when d[Dm]own on her a r[Am]ight whale bore
The c[Am]aptain called all hands and swore, he'd t[E]ake that whale in [Am]tow

\gSec{Chorus}
S[F]oon may the W[C]ellerman come to b[Dm]ring us sugar and [Am]tea and rum
[F]One day, when the t[C]onguin’ is done, we’ll t[E]ake our leave and [Am]go

Bef[Am]ore the boat had hit the water, the wh[Dm]ale's tail came [Am]up and caught her
All h[Am]ands to the side, harpooned and fought her, when s[E]he dived down bel[Am]ow

\gSec{Chorus}
S[F]oon may the W[C]ellerman come to b[Dm]ring us sugar and [Am]tea and rum
[F]One day, when the t[C]onguin’ is done, we’ll t[E]ake our leave and [Am]go

No l[Am]ine was cut, no whale was freed; The C[Dm]aptain's mind was [Am]not of greed
But [Am]he belonged to the whaleman's creed; She t[E]ook the ship in t[Am]ow

\gSec{Chorus}
S[F]oon may the W[C]ellerman come to b[Dm]ring us sugar and [Am]tea and rum
[F]One day, when the t[C]onguin’ is done, we’ll t[E]ake our leave and [Am]go

For f[Am]orty days, or even more, the l[Dm]ine went slack, then t[Am]ight once more
All b[Am]oats were lost, there were only four, but st[E]ill that whale did [Am]go

\gSec{Chorus}
S[F]oon may the W[C]ellerman come to b[Dm]ring us sugar and [Am]tea and rum
[F]One day, when the t[C]onguin’ is done, we’ll t[E]ake our leave and [Am]go

As [Am]far as I've heard, the fight's still on; The l[Dm]ine's not cut and the w[Am]hale's not gone
The W[Am]ellerman makes his regular call, to en[Dm]courage the Captain, c[Am]rew, and all

\gSec{Chorus}
S[F]oon may the W[C]ellerman come to b[Dm]ring us sugar and [Am]tea and rum
[F]One day, when the t[C]onguin’ is done, we’ll t[E]ake our leave and [Am]go
