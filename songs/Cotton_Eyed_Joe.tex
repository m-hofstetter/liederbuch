\begin{song}{Cotton Eyed Joe}{Traditionell}{}
[G]Way back yonder a  [C]long time [G]ago, Daddy worked a man called  [D]Cotton-Eyed  [G]Joe
[G]Blew into town on a  [C]travelin' [G]show, nobody danced like the  [D]Cotton-Eyed  [G]Joe

\gSec{Chorus}
[G]If it hadn't been for [C]Cotton-Eye [G]Joe, I'd been married a [D]long time [G]ago
[G]Where did you come from, [C]where did you [G]go? Where did you come from, [D]Cotton-Eye [G]Joe?

[G]He came to town like a [C]midwinter [G]storm, he rode through the fields, so [D]handsome and [G]strong
[G]His eyes was his tools and his [C]smile was his [G]gun, but all he had come for was [D]having some [G]fun

\gSec{Chorus}
[G]If it hadn't been for [C]Cotton-Eye [G]Joe, I'd been married a [D]long time [G]ago
[G]Where did you come from, [C]where did you [G]go? Where did you come from, [D]Cotton-Eye [G]Joe?

[G]Mama's at the window, [C]Mama's at the [G]door, she can't see nothin' but the [D]Cotton-Eyed [G]Joe
[G]Daddy held the fiddle, [C]I held the [G]bow an' we beat the crud out of [D]Cotton-Eyed [G]Joe

\gSec{Chorus}
[G]If it hadn't been for [C]Cotton-Eye [G]Joe, I'd been married a [D]long time [G]ago
[G]Where did you come from, [C]where did you [G]go? Where did you come from, [D]Cotton-Eye [G]Joe?

[G]Made himself a a fiddle, [C]made himself a [G]bow, made a little tune called [D]Cotton-Eyed [G]Joe
[G]Hadn't oughta been for [C]Cotton-Eyed [G]Joe, I'd a-been married a [D]long time [G]ago

\gSec{Chorus}
[G]If it hadn't been for [C]Cotton-Eye [G]Joe, I'd been married a [D]long time [G]ago
[G]Where did you come from, [C]where did you [G]go? Where did you come from, [D]Cotton-Eye [G]Joe?

[G]Whenever there's a dance all the [C]women want to [G]go and they all want to dance with the [D]Cotton-Eyed [G]Joe
[G]Daddy won't say but I [C]think he [G]knows, whatever happened to [D]Cotton-Eyed [G]Joe

\gSec{Chorus}
[G]If it hadn't been for [C]Cotton-Eye [G]Joe, I'd been married a [D]long time [G]ago
[G]Where did you come from, [C]where did you [G]go? Where did you come from, [D]Cotton-Eye [G]Joe?

[G]He brought disaster wher[C]ever he [G]went, the hearts of the girls was to [C]Hell, broken, [G]sent
[G]They all ran away so [C]nobody would [G]know and left only men 'cause of [C]Cotton-Eye [G]Joe

\gSec{Chorus}
[G]If it hadn't been for [C]Cotton-Eye [G]Joe, I'd been married a [D]long time [G]ago
[G]Where did you come from, [C]where did you [G]go? Where did you come from, [D]Cotton-Eye [G]Joe?
