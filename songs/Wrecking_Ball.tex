\begin{song}[2]{Wrecking Ball}{Miley Cyrus}{}
We [Am]clawed, we chained, our he[C]arts in vain
We jum[G]ped, never askin[F]g why
[Am]We kissed, I fell und[C]er your spell
A l[G]ove no one [F]could deny

[Am]Dont you ever say [C]I just walked away
[G]I will always want[F] you
[Am]I cant live a lie, r[C]unning for my life
[G]I will always w[F]ant you

\gSec{Chorus}
I came in like a [C]wrecking ball[G]{\hh}
I never hit so [Am]hard in [F]love
All I wanted was to [C]break your [G]walls
All you ever did was[Am] wreck [F]me
Yeah, [Am]you wreck [F]me

I [Am]put you high up [C]in the sky
And n[G]ow, youre not coming[F] down
It [Am]slowly turned, you l[C]et me burn
And [G]now, weâ€™re ashes on the g[F]round

[Am]Dont you ever say [C]I just walked away
[G]I will always want[F] you
[Am]I cant live a lie, r[C]unning for my life
[G]I will always w[F]ant you

\gSec{Chorus}
I came in like a [C]wrecking ball[G]{\hh}
I never hit so [Am]hard in [F]love
All I wanted was to [C]break your [G]walls
All you ever did was[Am] wreck [F]me
I came in like a w[C]recking bal[G]l
Yeah, I just closed my [Am]eyes and swung[F]{\hh}
Left me crouchi[C]ng in a blaze and fal[G]l
All you ever did was[Am] wreck [F]me
Yeah, [Am]you wreck [F]me
