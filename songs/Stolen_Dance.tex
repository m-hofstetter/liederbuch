\begin{song}{Stolen Dance}{Milky Chance}{}
[Am]I want you[G] by my [F]side
[C]So that I never feel [E]alone again
[Am]They've always [G]been s[F]o kind
[C]But now they've brought you [E]away from here
[Am]I hope they [G]didn't get you[F]r mind
[C]Your heart is too strong [E]anyway
[Am]We need to[G] fetch back th[F]e time
[C]They have stolen from [E]us

\gSec{Chorus $\times$2}
[F]And I want you
[C]We can bring it on the floor
You've never [E]danced like this [Am]before
We don't [G]talk about it
[F]Dancin' on, do the [C]boogie all night long
[E]Stoned in pa[Am]radise

[Am]Shouldn't talk about it, shouldn't talk about it

[Am]Coldest wi[G]nter fo[F]r me
[C]No sun is shining [E]anymore
[Am]The only t[G]hing I [F]feel is pain
[C]Caused by absence [E]of you
[Am]Suspense i[G]s contr[F]olling my mind
[C]I cannot find the [E]way out of here
[Am]I want you[G] by my [F]side
[C]So that I never feel [E]alone again

\gSec{Chorus $\times$4}
[F]And I want you
[C]We can bring it on the floor
You've never [E]danced like this [Am]before
But we don't [G]talk about it
[F]Dancin on doin the [C]boogie all night long
[E]Stoned in pa[Am]radise
[G]Shouldn't talk about it
