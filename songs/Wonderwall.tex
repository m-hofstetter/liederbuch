\begin{song}[2]{Wonderwall}{Oasis}{}
[Em]Today is [G]gonna be the day that they're [D]gonna throw it back to [A]you,
[Em]By now you [G]should've somehow rea[D]lised what you gotta [A]do.
[Em]I don't believe that [G]anybody [D]feels the way I [A]do about you [C]now.[D]{\hh}[A]{\hh}

[Em]Back beat, the [G]word is on the street that the [D]fire in your heart is [A]out,
[Em]I'm sure you've [G]heard it all before, but you [D]never really had a [A]doubt.
[Em]I don't believe that [G]anybody [D]feels the way I [A]do about you [Em]now.[G]{\hh}[D]{\hh}[A]{\hh}

And [C]all the roads we [D]have to walk are [Em]winding,
And [C]all the lights that [D]lead us there are [Em]blinding,
[C]There are many [D]things that I would [G]like to say to [Em]you
But I [G]don't know [A]how.

\gSec{Chorus}
Because [C]maybe,[Em]{\hh}[G]{\hh}
You're [Em]gonna be the one that [C]saves me,[Em]{\hh}[G]{\hh}
And [Em]after [C]all,[Em]{\hh}[G]{\hh}
You're my [Em]wonder[C]wall.[Em]{\hh}[G]{\hh}[Em]{\hh}

[Em]Today was [G]gonna be the day, but they'll [D]never throw it back to [A]you,
[Em]By now you [G]should have somehow rea[D]lised what you're not to [A]do.
[Em]I don't believe that [G]anybody [D]feels the way I [A]do about you [Em]now.[G]{\hh}[D]{\hh}[A]{\hh}

And [C]all the roads that l[D]ead you there are [Em]winding,
And [C]all the lights that [D]light the way are [Em]blinding,
[C]There are many [D]things that I would [G]like to say to [Em]you
But I [G]don't know [A]how.

\gSec{Chorus}
I said m[C]aybe,[Em]{\hh}[G]{\hh}
You're [Em]gonna be the one that [C]saves me,[Em]{\hh}[G]{\hh}
And [Em]after [C]all,[Em]{\hh}[G]{\hh}
You're my [Em]wonder[C]wall.[Em]{\hh}[G]{\hh}[Em]{\hh}
I said m[C]aybe,[Em]{\hh}[G]{\hh}
You're [Em]gonna be the one that [C]saves me,[Em]{\hh}[G]{\hh}
And [Em]after [C]all,[Em]{\hh}[G]{\hh}
You're my [Em]wonder[C]wall.[Em]{\hh}[G]{\hh}[Em]{\hh}
I said m[C]aybe,[Em]{\hh}[G]{\hh}

You're [Em]gonna be the one that [C]saves me,[Em]{\hh}[G]{\hh}
You're [Em]gonna be the one that [C]saves me,[Em]{\hh}[G]{\hh}
You're [Em]gonna be the one that [C]saves me,[Em]{\hh}[G]{\hh}[Em]{\hh}
