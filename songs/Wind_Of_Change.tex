\begin{song}{Wind of Change}{Scorpions}{}
[C]I follow the Mosk[Dm]va down to Gorky [C]Park, listening to the [Dm]wind of [Am]chan[G]ge
[C]An August summer [Dm]night, soldiers passing [C]by, listening to the [Dm]wind of [Am]chan[G]ge

[C]The world is closing [Dm]in, and did you ever [C]think, that we could be so [Dm]close, like [Am]brothe[G]rs?
[C]The future's in the [Dm]air, I can feel it every[C]where, blowing with the [Dm]wind of [Am]chan[G]ge

\gSec{Chorus}
[C]Take [G]me, to the [Dm]magic of the [G7]moment, on a [C]glory [G]night,
where the [Dm]children of to[G]morrow dream a[Am]way, [F]in the wind of [G]change

[C]Walking down the [Dm]street, distant memor[C]ies are buried in the [Dm]past, for[Am]eve[G]r
[C]I follow the Mosk[Dm]va down to Gorky [C]Park, listening to the [Dm]wind of [Am]chan[G]ge

\gSec{Chorus}
[C]Take [G]me, to the [Dm]magic of the [G7]moment, on a [C]glory [G]night,
where the [Dm]children of to[G]morrow share their [Am]dreams [F]with you and [G]me
[C]Take [G]me, to the [Dm]magic of the [G7]moment, on a [C]glory [G]night,
where the [Dm]children of to[G]morrow dream a[Am]way, [F]in the wind of [G]change

[Am]The wind of change blows [G]straight, into the face of [Am]time
Like a storm wind that will [G]ring the freedom bell for peace of [C]mind
Let your balalaika [Dm]sing, what my guitar wants to [E7]say

\gSec{Chorus}
[C]Take [G]me, to the [Dm]magic of the [G7]moment on a [C]glory [G]night,
where the [Dm]children of to[G]morrow share their [Am]dreams [F]with you and [G]me
[C]Take [G]me, to the [Dm]magic of the [G7]moment on a [C]glory [G]night,
where the [Dm]children of to[G]morrow dream a[Am]way [F]in the wind of [G]change
