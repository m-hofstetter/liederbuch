[D]When we arriv[G]e, sons and daughters, [D]we'll make our [G]homes on the water
[D]We'll build our [G]walls aluminum 
[D]We'll fill our [G]mouths with cinnamo[D]n now

[D]These currents [G]pull us 'cross the border, [D]steady your [G]boats, arms to shoulder
[D]Till tides'll pu[G]ll our hull aground
[D]Making this [G]cold harbor n[D]ow home

[D]Take up your [G]arms, sons and daughters, [D]we will ar[G]ise from the bunkers
[D]By land, by s[G]ea, by dirigible
[D]We'll leave our [G]tracks untraceabl[D]e now

[D]When we arriv[G]e, sons and daughters, [D]we'll make our [G]homes on the water
[D]We'll build our [G]walls aluminum
[D]We'll fill our [G]mouths with cinnamo[D]n now
