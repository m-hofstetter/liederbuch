\begin{song}{Lady in Black}{Uriah Heep}{}She [Am]came to me one morning, one [Am]lonely Sunday morning
Her [G]long hair flowing in the [Am]midwinter wind
I [Am]know not how she found me for in [Am]darkness I was walking
And des[G]truction lay around me from a [Am]fight I could not win

\gSec{Chorus}
[Am]Ahh ... Ahh ... [G]Ahh ... [Am]Ahh ...
[Am]Ahh ... [G]Ahh ... [Am]Ahh ...

She [Am]asked me name my foe then, I [Am]said the need within some men
To [G]fight and kill their brothers without [Am]thought of love or God
And I [Am]begged her give me horses to [Am]trample down my enemies
So [G]eager was my passion to de[Am]vour this waste of life

\gSec{Chorus}
[Am]Ahh ... Ahh ... [G]Ahh ... [Am]Ahh ...
[Am]Ahh ... [G]Ahh ... [Am]Ahh ...

But she [Am]would not think of battle that re[Am]duces men to animals
So [G]easy to begin and yet im[Am]possible to end
For [Am]she's the mother of our men who [Am]counselled me so wisely then
I [G]feared to walk alone again and as[Am]ked if she would stay

\gSec{Chorus}
[Am]Ahh ... Ahh ... [G]Ahh ... [Am]Ahh ...
[Am]Ahh ... [G]Ahh ... [Am]Ahh ...

Oh, [Am]lady lend your hand outright and [Am]let me rest here at your side
Have [G]faith and trust in peace she said and [Am]filled my heart with life
There [Am]is no strength in numbers, have [Am]no such misconception
But [G]when you need me be assured I [Am]won't be far away

\gSec{Chorus}
[Am]Ahh ... Ahh ... [G]Ahh ... [Am]Ahh ...
[Am]Ahh ... [G]Ahh ... [Am]Ahh ...

Thus [Am]having spoke she turned away and [Am]though I found no words to say
I s[G]tood and watched until I saw her [Am]black coat disappear
My [Am]labour is no easier but [Am]now I know I'm not alone
I [G]find new heart each time I think u[Am]pon that windy day
And [Am]if one day she comes to you drink [Am]deeply from her words so wise
Take [G]courage from her as your prize and [Am]say hello from me

\gSec{Chorus}
[Am]Ahh ... Ahh ... [G]Ahh ... [Am]Ahh ...
[Am]Ahh ... [G]Ahh ... [Am]Ahh ...
