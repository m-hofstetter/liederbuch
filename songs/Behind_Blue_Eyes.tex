\begin{song}{Behind Blue eyes}{Limp Bizkit}{}       
[Em]No one knows what it's [G]like,
To be the [D]bad man, to be the [C]sad man be[A]hind blue eyes
And [Em]no one knows what it's [G]like,
To be [D]hated, to be [C]fated, to telling [A]only lies

\gSec{Chorus}
But my [C]dreams[D]{\h}
They aren't as [G]empty, as my [C]conscience [D]seems to [E]be
I have [Bm]hours, only [C]lonely
My love is [D]vengeance
That's never [A]free

[Em]No one knows what it's [G]like
To feel these [D]feelin's, like I [C]do and I blame [A]you
No [Em]one bites back as [G]hard on their [D]anger
None of my [C]pain an' woe can show [A]through

\gSec{Chorus}
But my [C]dreams[D]{\h}
They aren't as [G]empty, as my [C]conscience [D]seems to [E]be
I have [Bm]hours, only [C]lonely
My love is [D]vengeance
That's never [A]free

[Em]No one knows what it's [G]like, to be mis[D]treated, to be de[C]feated
Be[A]hind blue eyes
And [Em]no one knows how to [G]say
That they're [D]sorry an' don't [C]worry
I'm not [A]telling lies

\gSec{Chorus}
But my [C]dreams[D]{\h}
They aren't as [G]empty, as my [C]conscience [D]seems to [E]be
I have [Bm]hours, only [C]lonely
My love is [D]vengeance
That's never [A]free

No [Em]one knows what it's [G]like
To be the [D]bad man
To be the [C]sad man
Be[A]hind blue eyes
