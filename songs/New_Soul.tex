\begin{song}{New Soul}{Yael Naim}{}
[C]I'm a new soul I came to this [F]strange world hoping I could
[Am]learn a bit about [G]how to give and [C]take
[C]But since I came here felt the joy and [F]the fear finding myself
[Am]making every [G]possible [C]mistake

[C]la-l[F]a-la[Am]-la-l[G]a-la[C]-la-la...

[C]I'm a young soul in this very [F]strange world hoping I could
[Am]learn a bit about what [G]is true and [C]fake.
[C]But why all this hate? Try to   commun[F]icate finding just that
[Am]love is not al-[G]ways easy to [C]make.

[C]la-l[F]a-la[Am]-la-l[G]a-la[C]-la-la...

[Gm]This is a happy end cause' [C]you don't under - stand
[F]everything you have done - [Fm]why's everything so wrong
[Gm]This is a happy end c[C]ome and give me your hand
[F]I'll take you [Fm]far away

[C]I'm a new soul I came to this [F]strange world hoping I could
[Am]learn a bit about [G]how to give and [C]take
[C]but since I came here felt the joy and [F]the fear find-ing myself
[Am]making every [G]possible [C]mistake

[C]la-l[F]a-la[Am]-la-l[G]a-la[C]-la-la
[C]la-l[F]a-la[Am]-la-l[G]a-la[C]-la-la...
