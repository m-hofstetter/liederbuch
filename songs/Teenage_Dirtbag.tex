[C]Her name is No[G]elle, [C]I had a [F]dream about her
[C]She rings my b[G]ell, [C]got gym class in h[F]alf an hour
[C]Oh, how she [G]rocks, in K[C]eds and t[F]ube socks
[Am]But she doesn't k[F]now who I [G]am
[Am]And she doesn't [F]give a d[G]amn about me

\gSec{Chorus}
[C]I'm just a te[F]enage dir[G]tbag baby
[C]Yeah, I'm just a te[F]enage dir[G]tbag baby
[C]Listen to [F]Iron [G]Maiden baby, with me

[C]Her boyfriend's a d[G]ick, h[C]e brings a gun into s[F]chool
[C]And he'd simply k[G]ick m[C]y ass if he k[F]new the truth
[C]He lives on my [G]block [C]and drives an I[F]ROC
[Am]But he doesn't k[F]now who[G] I am
[Am]And he doesn't [F]give a d[G]amn about me

\gSec{Chorus}
[C]I'm just a [F]teenage [G]dirtbag baby
[C]Yeah, I'm just a [F]teenage [G]dirtbag baby

[C]Oh y[F]eah, [G]dirtbag! [C]No, she doesn't [F]know what she's [G]missing

[C]Man, I feel like [G]mould
[C]It's prom night and [F]I am lonely
[C]Lo and [G]behold
[C]She's walking [F]over to me
[C]This must be [G]fake
[C]My lip starts to [F]shake
[Am]How does she [F]know who I[G] am
[Am]And why does she [F]give a [G]damn about me

\gSec{Chorus}
[C]I've got two ti[F]ckets to [G]Iron Maiden baby, [C]come with me F[F]riday, [G]don't say maybe
[C]I'm just a [F]teenage [G]dirtbag baby [C]like [F]you[G]{\hh}
