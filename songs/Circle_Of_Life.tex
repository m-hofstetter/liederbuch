\begin{song}[3]{Circle of Life}{Weise: Elton John, Worte: Tim Rice}{}
[G]Nants ingonyama bagithi Baba
Sithi [C]uhm[D] in[G]gonyama
[Am]Ingonya[Em]ma, siyo N[D]qob[G]a,[Am]{\h} Ingo[Em]nyama[D]{\h}[G]{\h}
[G]Ingonyama nengw' enamabala,[Em] ingonyama nengw' enamabala.
[Am]Ingonyama nengw' enamabala, [D]ingonyama nengw' enamabala.

From the [G]day we arrive on the [Am]planet and [D]blinking, step into the [G]sun
There's [Em]more to see than can [Am]ever be seen, more to [F]do than can ever be [D]done

Some say: “[G]eat or b[Am]e eaten”, some say: “[D]live and let [G]live”
But [Em]all are agreed as they [Am]join the stampede: You should [F]never take more then you [D]give.

\gSec{Chorus}
It's the Circle of [G]Life
And it moves us [F]all
Through despair and [C]hope
Through faith and [D]love
Till we find our [G]place
[E]On the path unwi[Am]nding[Cm]{\h}
In the [G]Circle[D]{\h}
The [D]Circle of [C]Life[G]{\h}

[G]Some of us fall by the [Am]wayside and [D]some of us soar to the [G]stars
And [Em]some of us sail through our [Am]troubles and [F]some have to live with the [D]scars

There’s [G]far too much to take [Am]in here, more to [D]find than can ever be [G]found
But the [Em]sun rolling high, through the [Am]sapphire sky keeps great and [F]small on the endless [D]round

\gSec{Chorus}
It's the Circle of [G]Life
And it moves us [F]all
Through despair and [C]hope
Through faith and [D]love
Till we find our [G]place
[E]On the path unwi[Am]nding[Cm]{\h}
In the[G] Circle[D]{\h}
The [D]Circle of [C]Life[G]{\h}
