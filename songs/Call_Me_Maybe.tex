\begin{song}{Call Me Maybe}{Carly Rae Jepsen}{}
[G]I threw a wish in the well, [Em]don't ask me, I'll never tell
[C]I looked to you as it fell, [D]and now you're in my way
[G]I trade my soul for a wish, [Em]pennies and dimes for a kiss
[C]I wasn't looking for this, [D]but now you're in my way
[G]Your stare was holdin', ripped jea[Em]ns, skin was showin'
[C]Hot night, wind was blowin', [D]where you think you're going, baby?

\gSec{Chorus}
[G]Hey, I just met you, [D]and this is crazy,
[C]but here's my number, [D]so call me, maybe?
[G]It's hard to look right [D]at you baby,
[C]but here's my number, [D]so call me maybe?
[G]Hey, I just met you, [D]and this is crazy,
[C]but here's my number, [D]so call me, maybe?
[G]And all the other boys, [D]try to chase me,
[C]but here's my number, [D]so call me, maybe?

[G]You took your time with the call, [Em]I took no time with the fall
[C]You gave me nothing at all, [D]but still, you're in my way
[G]I beg and borrow and steal [Em]at first sight and it's real
[C]I didn't know I would feel it, [D]but it's in my way
[G]Your stare was holdin', ripped jea[Em]ns, skin was showin'
[C]Hot night, wind was blowin', [D]where you think you're going, baby?

\gSec{Chorus}
[G]Hey, I just met you, [D]and this is crazy,
[C]but here's my number, [D]so call me, maybe?
[G]It's hard to look right [D]at you baby,
[C]but here's my number, [D]so call me maybe?
[G]Hey, I just met you, [D]and this is crazy,
[C]but here's my number, [D]so call me, maybe?
[G]And all the other boys, [D]try to chase me,
[C]but here's my number, [D]so call me, maybe?
