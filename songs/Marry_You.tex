\gSec{Chorus}
[D]It’s a beautiful night, we’re looking for something [Em]dumb to do,
Hey [G]baby, I think I want to marry [D]you.

[D]Is it that look in your eyes,
Or is it this [Em]dancing juice?
Who [G]cares baby, I think I wanna marry [D]you.

[D]Well I know this little chapel on the boulevard we can[Em] go,
No one will [G]know, come [D]on girl.

[D]Who cares if we're trashed got a pocket full of cash we can [Em]blow,
Shots of [G]patron, And it's [D]on girl.

[D]Don't say no, no, no, no-no;
Just say [Em]yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah-yeah;
And we'll [G]go, go, go, go-go.
If you're [D]ready, like I'm ready.

\gSec{Chorus}
[D]Cause it's a beautiful night, we're looking for something [Em]dumb to do.
Hey [G]baby, I think I wanna marry [D]you.

[D]Is it the look in your eyes,
Or is it this [Em]dancing juice?
Who [G]cares baby, I think I wanna marry [D]you.

[D]I'll go get a ring let the choir bells sing like [Em]oooh,
So whatcha wanna [G]do? Let's just [D]run girl.
[D]If we wake up and you wanna break up that's [Em]cool.
No, I won't blame [G]you; It was [D]fun girl.

[D]Don't say no, no, no, no-no;
Just say [Em]yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah-yeah;
And we'll [G]go, go, go, go-go.
If you're [D]ready, like I'm ready.

\gSec{Chorus}
[D]Cause it's a beautiful night, we're looking for something [Em]dumb to do.
Hey [G]baby, I think I wanna marry [D]you.

[D]Is it the look in your eyes,
Or is it this [Em]dancing juice?
Who [G]cares baby, I think I wanna marry [D]you.
