\begin{song}[1]{Viva La Vida}{Coldplay}{}
[Em]I used to [C]rule the [D]world
Seas would [G]rise when I gave the [Em]word
Now in the morning I [C]sleep al[D]one
Sweep the [G]streets I used to [Em]own

[Em]I used to[C] roll the [D]dice
Feel the f[G]ear in my enemy's [Em]eyes
Listen as the [C]crowd would s[D]ing:
``Now the [G]old king is dead! [Em]Long live the king!''

On[Em]e minute I [C]held the [D]key
Next the [G]walls were closed on [Em]me
And I discovered that my c[C]astles st[D]and
Upon [G]pillars of salt and p[Em]illars of sand

\gSec{Chorus}
I [C]hear Jerusalem [D]bells are ringing, [G]Roman Cavalry [Em]choirs are singing
[C]Be my mirror, my [D]sword, and shield, my [G]missionaries in a [Em]foreign field
[C]For some reason I [D]can't explain
[G]Once you go there was [Em]never, never an [C]honest [D]word
That was [Bm]when I ruled the [Em]world

[Em]It was the wicked and[C] wild [D]wind
Blew down the [G]doors to let me [Em]in.
Shattered windows and the [C]sound of [D]drums
People [G]couldn't believe what[Em] I'd become

[Em]Revolutio[C]naries [D]wait
For my h[G]ead on a silver [Em]plate
Just a puppet on a [C]lonely [D]string
Oh [G]who would ever want to be [Em]king?

\gSec{Chorus}
I [C]hear Jerusalem [D]bells are ringing, [G]Roman Cavalry [Em]choirs are singing
[C]Be my mirror, my [D]sword, and shield, my [G]missionaries in a [Em]foreign field
[C]For some reason I [D]can't explain
I [G]know Saint Peter won't[Em] call my name, nev[C]er an honest [D]word
But that was w[Bm]hen I ruled the w[Em]orld
