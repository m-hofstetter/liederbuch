\begin{song}[1]{Mad World}{Gary Jules}{}
[Em]All around me are fa[G]miliar faces
[D]Worn out places, [A]worn out faces[Em]{\h}
Bright and early for their [G]daily races
[D]Going nowhere, [A]going nowhere[Em]{\h}
Their tears are filling [G]up their glasses
[D]No expression, [A]no expression[Em]{\h}
Hide my head, I want to [G]drown my sorrow
[D]No tomorrow, [A]no tomorrow[Em]{\h}

\gSec{Chorus}
And I find it kinda [A]funny, I find it kinda [Em]sad
The dreams in which I'm [A]dying are the best I've ever [Em]had
I find it hard to [A]tell you, I find it hard to [Em]take
When people run in [A]circles, it's a very, very[Em]{\h}
Mad w[A]orld[Em]{\h}
Mad w[A]orld[Em]{\h}

Children waiting for the [G]day they feel good
[D]Happy birthday, [A]happy birthday[Em]{\h}
Made to feel the way that [G]every child should
[D]Sit and listen, [A]sit and listen[Em]{\h}
Went to school, and I was [G]very nervous
[D]No one knew me, [A]no one knew me[Em]{\h}
Hello, teacher, tell me [G]what's my lesson[Em]{\h}
[D]Look right through me, [A]look right through me[Em]{\h}

\gSec{Chorus}
And I find it kinda [A]funny, I find it kinda [Em]sad
The dreams in which I'm [A]dying are the best I've ever [Em]had
I find it hard to [A]tell you, I find it hard to [Em]take
When people run in [A]circles, it's a very, very[Em]{\h}
Mad w[A]orld[Em]{\h}
Mad w[A]orld
