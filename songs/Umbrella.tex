\begin{song}[1]{Umbrella}{Rihanna}{}
You [F]have my heart, and we'll never be [C]worlds apart
Maybe in [E]magazines, but you'll still [Am]be my star
Baby, ‘cause [F]in the dark, you can't see [C]shiny cars
And that's when you [E]need me there
With you I'll [Am]always share... Because![F]{\h}

\gSec{Chorus}
When the sun shines, we’ll shine toge[C]ther
Told you I'll be here fore[G]ver
Said I'll always be your [Am]friend
Took an oath, I'ma stick it out to the e[F]nd
Now that it's raining more than e[C]ver
Know that we still have each o[G]ther
You can stand under my umbrel[Am]la
You can stand under my umbrel[F]la

Ella ella eh [C]eh eh
Under my umbrel[E]la ella ella eh [Am]eh eh
Under my umbrel[F]la ella ella eh [C]eh eh
Under my umbrel[E]la ella ella eh [Am]eh eh eh eh eh

These [F]fancy things, will never come [C]in between
You're part of my [E]entity, here for in[Am]finity
When the war has [F]took it's part
When the world has [C]dealt it's cards
If the [E]hand is hard, together we'll [Am]mend your heart... Because![F]{\h}

\gSec{Chorus}
When the sun shines, we’ll shine toge[C]ther
Told you I'll be here fore[G]ver
Said I'll always be your [Am]friend
Took an oath, I'ma stick it out to the e[F]nd
Now that it's raining more than e[C]ver
Know that we still have each o[G]ther
You can stand under my umbrel[Am]la
You can stand under my umbrel[F]la

Ella ella eh [C]eh eh
Under my umbrel[E]la ella ella eh [Am]eh eh
Under my umbrel[F]la ella ella eh [C]eh eh
Under my umbrel[E]la ella ella eh [Am]eh eh eh eh eh

[Bb]You can run into my arms
[F]It's okay don't be alarmed (Come [C]into me)
[Bb]So gonna let the rain [F]pour
I'll be all you need and [E]more... Because![F]{\h}

\gSec{Chorus}
When the sun shines, we’ll shine toge[C]ther
Told you I'll be here fore[G]ver
Said I'll always be your [Am]friend
Took an oath, I'ma stick it out to the e[F]nd
Now that it's raining more than e[C]ver
Know that we still have each o[G]ther

Ooo baby it's [C]raining
You can always come [G]into me
