\begin{song}{A Horse With No Name}{America}{}        
On the [Em]first part of the [D]journey
I was l[Em]ookin at all the l[D]ife
There were p[Em]lants and birds and[D] rocks and things
There were s[Em]and and hills and [D]rings

The fir[Em]st thing I met was a[D] fly with a buzz
and the s[Em]ky with no cl[D]ouds
the h[Em]eat was hot and the g[D]round was dry
but the a[Em]ir was full of s[D]ound

\gSec{Chorus}
I've b[Em]een through the desert on a [D]horse with no name
it felt [Em]good to be out of the [D]rain
in the [Em]desert you can[D] remember your name
'cause there a[Em]in't no one for to [D]give you no pain
La [Em]la   la[D] la lala la lala [Em]la la l[D]a

After t[Em]wo days in the des[D]ert sun
my s[Em]kin began to turn [D]red
After t[Em]hree days in the[D] desert fun
I was l[Em]ooking at a river [D]bed
And the [Em]story it told of a[D] river that flowed
made me[Em] sad to think it wa[D]s dead

\gSec{Chorus}
I've b[Em]een through the desert on a [D]horse with no name
it felt [Em]good to be out of the [D]rain
in the [Em]desert you can[D] remember your name
'cause there a[Em]in't no one for to [D]give you no pain
La [Em]la   la[D] la lala la lala [Em]la la l[D]a

After n[Em]ine days I let the[D] horse run free
'cause the d[Em]esert had turned t[D]o sea
there were p[Em]lants and birds and [D]rocks and things
there were sa[Em]nd and hills and r[D]ings
The oc[Em]ean is a desert with it's [D]life underground
and the pe[Em]rfect disguise a[D]bove
Under the ci[Em]ties lies a h[D]eart made of ground
but the h[Em]umans will give no [D]love

\gSec{Chorus}
