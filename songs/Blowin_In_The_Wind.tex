\begin{song}[2]{Blowin' in the Wind}{Bob Dylan}{}
[D]How many [G]roads must a [A]man walk [D]down,
before you [G]call him a [D]man
[D]How many [G]seas must a [A]white dove [D]sail,
before she [G]sleeps in the [A]sand
Yes, and [D]how many [G]times must the [A]cannonballs [D]fly,
before they're [G]forever [D]banned

\gSec{Chorus}
[G]The answer my[A] friend i[D]s blowin' in the [G]wind
The answer is [A]blowin' in the [D]wind

Yes, and [D]how many [G]years can a [A]mountain e[D]xist,
before it is [G]washed to the [D]sea
Yes, and [D]how many [G]years can some [A]people [D]exist,
before they're [G]allowed to be [A]free
Yes, and [D]how many [G]times can a [A]man turn his [D]head,
and pretend that he j[G]ust doesn't [D]see

\gSec{Chorus}
[G]The answer my[A] friend i[D]s blowin' in the [G]wind
The answer is [A]blowin' in the [D]wind

Yes, and [D]how many [G]times must a [A]man look [D]up,
before he can [G]see the [D]sky
Yes, and [D]how many [G]ears must [A]one man [D]have,
before he can [G]hear people [A]cry
Yes, and [D]how many [G]deaths will it [A]take till he [D]knows,
that too many [G]people have [D]died

\gSec{Chorus}
[G]The answer my[A] friend i[D]s blowin' in the [G]wind
The answer is [A]blowin' in the [D]wind
