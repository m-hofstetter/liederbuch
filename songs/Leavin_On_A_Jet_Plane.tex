\begin{song}{Leaving on a Jet Plane}{John Denver}{}
All my [G]bags are packed I'm [C]ready to go. I'm [G]standing here out[C]side your door.
I [G]hate to wake you [Am]up to  say good b[D7]ye, but the [G]dawn is breaking it’s [C]early morn.
The [G]taxi's waitin’ he's [C]blown his horn. A[G]lready I'm so l[Am]onesome I could d[D7]ie.

\gSec{Chorus}
So [G]kiss me and [C]smile for me.
T[G]ell me that you'll [C]wait for me.
[G]Hold me like you'll [Am]never let me g[D7]o.
Cause I'm [G]leavin’ [C]on a jet plane.[G]{\h}
Don't know when [C]I'll be back again.[G]{\h}
Oh [Am]babe, I hate to [D7]go.

There's so [G]many times I've [C]let you down. So [G]many times, I've [C]played around.
I [G]tell you now [C]they don't mean a [D7]thing. Every [G]place I go I'll [C]think of you.
Every [G]song I sing I'll [C]sing for you. When [G]I come back, I'll [C]bring your wedding [D7]ring.

\gSec{Chorus}
So [G]kiss me and [C]smile for me.
T[G]ell me that you'll [C]wait for me.
[G]Hold me like you'll [Am]never let me g[D7]o.
Cause I'm [G]leavin’ [C]on a jet plane.[G]{\h}
Don't know when [C]I'll be back again.[G]{\h}
Oh [Am]babe, I hate to [D7]go.

[G]Now the time [C]come to leave you. [G]One more time [C]let me kiss you.
Then [G]close your eyes [C]I'll be on my [D7]way. [G]Dream about the [C]days to come.
When [G]I won't have to [C]leave alone. A[G]bout the times [C]I won't have to [D7]say...

\gSec{Chorus}
So [G]kiss me and [C]smile for me.
T[G]ell me that you'll [C]wait for me.
[G]Hold me like you'll [Am]never let me g[D7]o.
Cause I'm [G]leavin’ [C]on a jet plane.[G]{\h}
Don't know when [C]I'll be back again.[G]{\h}
Oh [Am]babe, I hate to [D7]go.
