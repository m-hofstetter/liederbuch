\zusatzeintrag{Glory Glory Hallelujah}
Mine [G]eyes have seen the glory of the [G7]coming of the Lord;
He is [C]trampling out the vintage where the [G]grapes of wrath are [D7]stored;
He hath [G]loosed the fateful [G7]lightning of His [B7]terrible, swift [Em]sword;
His [Am]truth is [D4]mar[D]ching [G]on.

\gSec{Chorus}
[G]Glory! Glory! halle[G7]lujah! [C]Glory! [C7]Glory! halle[G]lu[G7]jah!
[G]Glory! G[G7]lory! hall[B7]eluj[Em]ah!  His [Am]truth is [D4]mar[D]ching [G]on.

I have [G]read a fiery gospel writ in [G7]burnished rows of steel:
``As ye [C]deal with my contemners, so with [G]you my grace shall [D7]deal;
Let the [G]Hero, born of [G7]woman, crush the [B7]serpent with his [Em]heel,
Since [Am]God is [D4]mar[D]ching [G]on.''

\gSec{Chorus}
[G]Glory! Glory! halle[G7]lujah! [C]Glory! [C7]Glory! halle[G]lu[G7]jah!
[G]Glory! G[G7]lory! hall[B7]eluj[Em]ah!  His [Am]truth is [D4]mar[D]ching [G]on.

He has [G]sounded forth the trumpet that shall [G7]never call retreat,
He is [C]sifting out the hearts of men be-[G]fore His judgment [D7]seat;
Oh, be [G]swift, my soul, to [G7]answer Him!  Be [B7]jubilant, my [Em]feet!
Our [Am]God is [D4]mar[D]ching [G]on!

\gSec{Chorus}
[G]Glory! Glory! halle[G7]lujah! [C]Glory! [C7]Glory! halle[G]lu[G7]jah!
[G]Glory! G[G7]lory! hall[B7]eluj[Em]ah!  His [Am]truth is [D4]mar[D]ching [G]on.

In the [G]beauty of the lilies Christ was [G7]born across the sea,
With a [C]glory in His bosom that trans-[G]figures you and [D7]me;
As He [G]died to make men [G7]holy, let us [B7]live to make men [Em]free,
While [Am]God is [D4]mar[D]ching [G]on.

\gSec{Chorus}
[G]Glory! Glory! halle[G7]lujah! [C]Glory! [C7]Glory! halle[G]lu[G7]jah!
[G]Glory! G[G7]lory! hall[B7]eluj[Em]ah!  His [Am]truth is [D4]mar[D]ching [G]on.

We can [G]almost hear the trumpet sound, the [G7]Lord's return is near;
There are [C]still so many people lost, His [G]message they must [D7]hear;
Father, [G]give us one more [G7]moment, One more [B7]day, just one more [Em]year-
With [Am]God we're [D4]mar[D]ching [G]on.

\gSec{Chorus}
[G]Glory! Glory! halle[G7]lujah! [C]Glory! [C7]Glory! halle[G]lu[G7]jah!
[G]Glory! G[G7]lory! hall[B7]eluj[Em]ah!  His [Am]truth is [D4]mar[D]ching [G]on.
His [Am]truth is [D4]mar[D]ching [Em]on.   His [Am]truth is [D4]mar[D]ching [G]on.
