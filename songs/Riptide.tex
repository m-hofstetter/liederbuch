\begin{song}[6]{Riptide}{Vance Joy}{}
[Em]I was scared of [D]dentists and the d[G]ark
[Em]I was scared of [D]pretty girls and s[G]tarting conversations
Oh, [Em]all my fr[D]iends are turning g[G]reen
You're the [Em]magician's as[D]sistant in their d[G]ream

Uh [Em]oooh [D]oooh  [G]oooh, uh [Em]oooh [D]oooh and they [G]come unstuck

\gSec{Chorus}
[Em]Lady, r[D]unnin' down to the [G]riptide
Taken away to the [Em]dark side
[D]I wanna be your [G]left hand man
And I [Em]love you [D]when you're singin' that [G]song and
I gotta lump in my [Em]throat 'cause [D]you're gonna sing the [G]words wrong

[Em]There's this movie [D]that I think you'll [G]like
This [Em]guy decides to [D]quit his job and [G]head to New York City
This c[Em]owboy's r[D]unning from himself[G]{\h}
[Em]She's been living [D]on the highest [G]shelf

Uh [Em]oooh [D]oooh  [G]oooh, uh [Em]oooh [D]oooh and they [G]come unstuck

\gSec{Chorus}
[Em]Lady, r[D]unnin' down to the [G]riptide
Taken away to the [Em]dark side
[D]I wanna be your [G]left hand man
And I [Em]love you [D]when you're singin' that [G]song and
I gotta lump in my [Em]throat 'cause [D]you're gonna sing the [G]words wrong

[Em]I just gotta, I just gotta kn[D]ow
[G]If you're gonna, if you're gonna st[C]ay
[Em]I just gotta, I just gotta k[D]now
[G]I can't have it, I can't have it [C]any other way

I [Em]swear she's [D]destined for the [G]screen
[Em]Closest thing to [D]Michelle Pfeiffer [G]that you've ever seen, oh

\gSec{Chorus ($\times$3)}
[Em]Lady, r[D]unnin' down to the [G]riptide
Taken away to the [Em]dark side
[D]I wanna be your [G]left hand man
I l[Em]ove you w[D]hen you're singin' that s[G]ong and
I gotta lump in my [Em]throat 'cause [D]you're gonna sing the w[G]ords wrong
