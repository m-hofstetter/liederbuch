\begin{song}[4]{Counting Stars}{OneRepublic}{}
\gSec{Chorus}
[Am]Lately, I've been, [C]I've been losing sleep
[G]Dreaming about the things that [F]we could be
But [Am]baby, I've been, [C]I've been praying hard,
[G]Said, no more counting dollars
[F]We'll be counting stars, yeah we'll be counting stars

[Am] \hh [C] \hh [G] \hh [F] \hh [Am] \hh [C] \hh [G] \hh [F] \hh
I see this [Am]life like a swinging vine
[C]Swing my heart across the line
[G]In my face is flashing signs
[F]Seek it out and ye shall find
[Am]Old, but I'm not that old
[C]Young, but I'm not that bold
[G]I don't think the world is sold
[F]I'm just doing what we're told

[Am]I\hspace{2.5mm} f[C]eel something so [G]right
Doing the [F]wrong thing
[Am]I\hspace{2.5mm} f[C]eel something so [G]wrong
Doing the [F]right thing
[F]I couldn't lie, couldn't lie, couldn't lie
[F]Everything that kills me makes me feel alive

\gSec{Chorus}
[Am]Lately, I've been, [C]I've been losing sleep
[G]Dreaming about the things that [F]we could be
[Am]But baby, I've been, [C]I've been praying hard,
[G]Said, no more counting dollars
[F]We'll be counting stars
[Am]Lately, I've been, [C]I've been losing sleep
[G]Dreaming about the things that [F]we could be
[Am]But baby, I've been, [C]I've been praying hard,
[G]Said, no more counting dollars
[F]We'll be, we'll be counting stars

[Am] \hh [C] \hh [G] \hh [F] \hh [Am] \hh [C] \hh [G] \hh [F] \hh\pagebreak
I feel the [Am]love and I feel it burn
[C]Down this river, every turn
[G]Hope is a four-letter word
[F]Make that money, watch it burn
[Am]Old, but I'm not that old
[C]Young, but I'm not that bold
[G]I don't think the world is sold
[F]I'm just doing what we're told

[Am]I fe[C]el something so wr[G]ong
Doing the [F]right thing
[F]I couldn't lie, couldn't lie, couldn't lie
[F]Everything that drowns me makes me wanna fly

\gSec{Chorus}
[Am]Lately, I've been, [C]I've been losing sleep
[G]Dreaming about the things that [F]we could be
But [Am]baby, I've been, [C]I've been praying hard,
[G]Said, no more counting dollars
[F]We'll be counting stars
[Am]Lately, I've been, [C]I've been losing sleep
[G]Dreaming about the things that [F]we could be
But [Am]baby, I've been, [C]I've been praying hard,
[G]Said, no more counting dollars
[F]We'll be, we'll be counting stars

[Am]Take that money, watch it burn
[C]Sink in the river, the lessons I learned
[G]Take that money, watch it burn
[F]Sink in the river, the lessons I learned
[Am]Take that money, watch it burn
[C]Sink in the river, the lessons I learned
[G]Take that money, watch it burn
[F]Sink in the river, the lessons I learned
