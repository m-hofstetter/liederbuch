\begin{song}{Let Her Go}{Passenger}{}
\gSec{Chorus}
Well, you only need the [C]light when it's burning low[G]{\hh}
Only miss the [D]sun when it starts to sn[Em]ow
Only know you l[C]ove her when you let her go[G]{\hh}[D]{\hh}
Only know you've been [C]high when you're feeling low[G]{\hh}
Only hate the [D]road when you're missin' ho[Em]me
Only know you l[C]ove her when you let her go[G]{\hh}
[D]And you let her go

[Em]Staring at the bottom of your [C]glass
Hoping o[D]ne day you'll make a dream [Bm]last
But dreams come sl[Em]ow and they go s[C]o fast[D]{\hh}
You [Em]see her when you close your [C]eyes
Maybe [D]one day you'll understand [Bm]why
Everything you [Em]touch surely d[C]ies[D]{\hh}

\gSec{Chorus}
But you only need the [C]light when it's burning low[G]{\hh}
Only miss the [D]sun when it starts to sn[Em]ow
Only know you l[C]ove her when you let her go[G]{\hh}[D]{\hh}
Only know you've been [C]high when you're feeling low[G]{\hh}
Only hate the [D]road when you're missin' ho[Em]me
Only know you l[C]ove her when you let her go[G]{\hh}[D]{\hh}

[Em]Staring at the ceiling in the [C]dark
Same old [D]empty feeling in your [Bm]heart
'Cause love comes sl[Em]ow and it goes s[C]o fast[D]{\hh}
Well you [Em]see her when you fall as[C]leep
But never to [D]touch and never to [Bm]keep
'Cause you loved her too [Em]much
And you dived to[C]o deep[D]{\hh}

\gSec{Chorus}
Well, you only need the [C]light when it's burning low[G]{\hh}
Only miss the [D]sun when it starts to sn[Em]ow
Only know you l[C]ove her when you let her go[G]{\hh}[D]{\hh}
Only know you've been [C]high when you're feeling low[G]{\hh}
Only hate the [D]road when you're missin' ho[Em]me
Only know you l[C]ove her when you let her g[G]o[D]{\hh}
\pagebreak
And you let her [Em]go oh [C]oh [D]oh
And you let her [Em]go oh [C]oh [D]oh
And you let her [Em]go[C]{\hh}[D]{\hh}[Bm]{\hh}

\gSec{Chorus}
'Cause you only need the [C]light when it's burning low[G]{\hh}
Only miss the [D]sun when it starts to sn[Em]ow
Only know you l[C]ove her when you let her go[G]{\hh}[D]{\hh}
Only know you've been [C]high when you're feeling low[G]{\hh}
Only hate the [D]road when you're missin' ho[Em]me
Only know you l[C]ove her when you let her go[G]{\hh}[D]{\hh}
'Cause you only need the [C]light when it's burning low[G]{\hh}
Only miss the [D]sun when it starts to sn[Em]ow
Only know you l[C]ove her when you let her go[G]{\hh}[D]{\hh}

[N.C.]Only know you've been high when you're feeling low
[]Only hate the road when you're missin' home
[]Only know you love her when you let her go
[]And you let her go
