\begin{song}{Puff the Magic Dragon}{Peter, Paul and Mary}{}
[G]Puff, the magic [Bm]dragon [C]lived by the [G]sea
And [C]frolicked in the [G]autumn [Em]mist in a [A7]land called Honah L[D7]ee,
[G]Little Jackie [Bm]Paper [C]loved that rascal [G]Puff,
And [C]brought him strings and [G]sealing [Em]wax and [A7]other f[D]ancy st[G]uff.[D]{\hh}

\gSec{Chorus}
Oh. [G]Puff, the magic [Bm]dragon [C]lived by the [G]sea
And [C]frolicked in the [G]autumn [Em]mist in a [A7]land called Honah [D7]Lee,
[G]Puff, the magic [Bm]dragon [C]lived by the [G]sea
And [C]frolicked in the [G]autumn [Em]mist in a [A7]land called [D]Honah [G]Lee.[D]{\hh}

[G]Together they would [Bm]travel [C]on a boat with [G]billowed sail
And [C]Jackie kept a [G]lookout [Em]perched on [A7]Puffâ€™s gigantic [D7]tail,
[G]Noble kings and [Bm]princes would [C]bow whenever they [G]came,
[C]Pirate ships would [G]lower their [Em]flags when [A7]Puff roared [D]out his n[G]ame. [D]oh!

\gSec{Chorus}
[G]Puff, the magic [Bm]dragon [C]lived by the [G]sea
And [C]frolicked in the [G]autumn [Em]mist in a [A7]land called Honah [D7]Lee,
[G]Puff, the magic [Bm]dragon [C]lived by the [G]sea
And [C]frolicked in the [G]autumn [Em]mist in a [A7]land called [D]Honah [G]Lee.[D]{\hh}

A [G]dragon lives [Bm]forever but [C]not so little [G]boys
[C]Painted wings and [G]giant [Em]rings make [A7]way for other [D7]toys.
[G]One grey night it [Bm]happened, [C]Jackie Paper [G]came no more
And [C]Puff that mighty [G]dragon[Em], he c[A7]eased his f[D]earless r[G]oar.[D]{\hh}

His [G]head was bent in [Bm]sorrow, [C]green scales fell like [G]rain,
[C]Puff no longer [G]went to [Em]play [A7]along the cherry [D7]lane.
With[G]out his life-long [Bm]friend, [C]Puff could not be [G]brave,
So [C]Puff that mighty [G]dragon [Em]sadly [A7]slipped int[D]o his c[G]ave.[D]{\hh}

\gSec{Chorus}
[G]Puff, the magic [Bm]dragon [C]lived by the [G]sea
And [C]frolicked in the [G]autumn [Em]mist in a [A7]land called Honah [D7]Lee,
[G]Puff, the magic [Bm]dragon [C]lived by the [G]sea
And [C]frolicked in the [G]autumn [Em]mist in a [A7]land called [D]Honah [G]Lee.[C]{\hh}[G]{\hh}
