\begin{song}{Summer of '69}{Bryan Adams}{}
\gSec{Chorus}
[D]I got my first real six string, [A]bought it at the five and dime
[D]Played it til my fingers bled, w[A]as the summer of '69
[D]Me and some guys from school, [A]had a band and we tried real hard
[D]Jimmy quit and Jody got married, [A]shoulda known we'd never get far

[Bm]Oh when I [A]look back now, [D]that summer seemed to l[G]ast forever
[Bm]And if I[A] had the choice,[D] ya I'd always w[G]anna be there
[Bm]Those were the be[A]st days of my life[D]{\hh}[A]{\hh}[D]{\hh}[A]{\hh}

[D]Ain't no use complaining, [A]when you gotta job to do
[D]Spent my evenings down at the drive in, [A]and that's when I met you, yeah!

\gSec{Chorus}
[Bm]Standing on your m[A]amma's porch,[D] you told me that you'd [G]wait forever
[Bm]And when you [A]held my hand, I [D]knew that it was [G]now or never
[Bm]Those were the be[A]st days of my life,[D]{\hh}[A]{\hh}[D]{\hh}[A]{\hh}
back in the summer of '69[D]{\hh}[A]{\hh}[D]{\hh}[A]{\hh}

[F]Man we were kil[A#]lin' time
We were yo[C]ung and reckless, we neede[A#]d to unwind
[F]I guess[A#] nothing can last fore[C]ver, forever, no...

[D]And now the times are changin',[A] look at everything that's come and gone
[D]Sometimes when I play my old six string,[A] I think about you and wonder what went wrong

\gSec{Chorus}
[Bm]Standing on your m[A]amma's porch, [D]you told me that you'd [G]wait forever
[Bm]And when you [A]held my hand, I [D]knew that it was [G]now or never
[Bm]Those were the be[A]st days of my life,[D]{\hh}[A]{\hh}[D]{\hh}[A]{\hh}
back in the summer of '69[D]{\hh}[A]{\hh}[D]{\hh}[A]{\hh}
