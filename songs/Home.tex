[Em]Alabama, Arkansas, [G]I do love my ma and pa,
[G/B]Not the way that[G] I do love[C] you. \hh\sprache{Home!}

[Em]Well, Holy, Moley, me, oh my, [G]you're the apple of my eye,
[G/B]Girl I've never [G]loved one like[C] you. \hh\sprache{Home!}

[Em]Man oh man you're my best friend, [G]I scream it to the nothingness,
[G/B]There ain't[G] nothing that I[C] need. \hh\sprache{Home!}

[Em]We laugh until we think weâ€™ll die, [G]barefoot on a summer night
[G/B]Never could be[G] sweeter than with[C] you \hh\sprache{Home!}

[Em]And in the streets you run afree, [G]like it's only you and me,
[G/B]Geeze, you're[G] something to[C] see.
