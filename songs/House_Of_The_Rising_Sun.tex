\begin{song}{House of the Rising Sun}{The Animals}{}
There [Am]is a [C]house in [D]New Orleans[F]{\hh}
They c[Am]all the ``[C]Rising [E]Sun''
And it's [Am]been the [C]ruin of [D]many a poor [F]boy
And [Am]God, I [E]know, I'm o[Am]ne[C]{\hh}[D]{\hh}[F]{\hh}[Am]{\hh}[E]{\hh}[Am]{\hh}[E]{\hh}

My [Am]mother [C]was a [D]tailor[F]{\hh}
She [Am]sewed my [C]new blue [E]jeans
My [Am]father [C]was a [D]gambling [F]man
[Am]Down in [E]New Orle[Am]ans.[C]{\hh}[D]{\hh}[F]{\hh}[Am]{\hh}[E]{\hh}[Am]{\hh}[E]{\hh}

Now the [Am]only [C]thing a [D]gambler [F]needs
Is a [Am]suitcase [C]and a [E]trunk
And the [Am]only [C]time, [D]he's satis[F]fied,
Is [Am]when he's [E]on a dr[Am]unk[C]{\hh}[D]{\hh}[F]{\hh}[Am]{\hh}[E]{\hh}[Am]{\hh}[E]{\hh}

O, [Am]mother,[C] tell your [D]children[F]{\hh}
Not to [Am]do what [C]I have [E]done
[Am]Spend your [C]lives in [D]sin and mise[F]ry
In the [Am]House of [E]Rising S[Am]un[C]{\hh}[D]{\hh}[F]{\hh}[Am]{\hh}[E]{\hh}[Am]{\hh}[E]{\hh}

Well, I got [Am]one foot [C]on the [D]platform[F]{\hh}
The [Am]other foot [C]on the [E]train
I'm [Am]going [C]back to [D]New Or[F]leans
To [Am]wear that [E]ball and c[Am]hain[C]{\hh}[D]{\hh}[F]{\hh}[Am]{\hh}[E]{\hh}[Am]{\hh}[E]{\hh}

Well, there [Am]is a [C]house in [D]New Orleans[F]{\hh}
They [Am]call the ``[C]Rising [E]Sun''
And it's [Am]been the [C]ruin of [D]many a poor [F]boy
And [Am]God, I [E7]know, I'm [Am]on[C]{\hh}[D]{\hh}[F]{\hh}[Am]{\hh}[E]{\hh}[Am]{\hh}[E]{\hh}
