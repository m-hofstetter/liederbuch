\begin{song}[2]{Don't Stop Believin'}{Journey}{}
[D]Just a [A]small town gir[Bm]l, living in [G]a lonely world
[D]She took the[A] midnight train going [F#m]anywhe[G]re
[D]Just a [A]city bo[Bm]y, born and raised in[G] south Detroit
[D]He took the[A] midnight train going [F#m]anywhe[G]re

[D]A singer in a [A]smoky roo[Bm]m, a smell of wine and[G] cheap perfume
[D]For a smile they can [A]share the night, it goes [F#m]on and on and [G]on and on

\gSec{Chorus}
[G]Strangers waiting [D]up and down the boulevard
T[G]heir shadows searching [D]in the night
[G]Streetlight, people, [D]living just to find emotion
[G]Hiding, somewhere in the [A]night

[D]Working hard to [A]get my fil[Bm]l, everybody[G] wants a thrill
Paying [D]anything to [A]roll the dice, just [F#m]one more [G]time
[D]Some will win, [A]some will lose, [Bm]some were born to[G] sing the blues
O[D]h, the movie [A]never ends; it goes [F#m]on and on and [G]on and on

\gSec{Chorus}
[G]Strangers waitin[D]g up and down the boulevard
T[G]heir shadows searching in the [D]night
[G]Streetlight, people[D], living just to find emotion
[G]Hiding, somewhere in the [A]night

[D]Don't stop bel[A]ieving h[Bm]old on to the [G]feeling
[D]Streetlight [A]people[F#m]{\h}[G]{\h}
[D]Don't stop bel[A]ieving h[Bm]old on to the [G]feeling
[D]Streetlight [A]people[F#m]{\h}[G]{\h}
[D]Don't stop bel[A]ieving h[Bm]old on to the [G]feeling
[D]Streetlight [A]people[F#m]{\h}[G]{\h}
