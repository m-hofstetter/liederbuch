A[E]ll the leaves are br[Am]own  (all the leaves are [F]brown)
And the s[G]ky is [E]gray  (and the sky is gray)
I[F]'ve been for a w[C]alk (I've been [E]for a [Am]walk)
On a w[F]inter's[E] day  (on a winter's day)
I'd be safe and w[Am]arm  (I'd be safe[F] and warm)
If I w[G]as in L. [E]A.  (if I was in L. A.)

\gSec{Chorus}
California [Am]dreamin' (California   [F]dreamin')
On [G]such a winter's [E]day

Stopped in to a c[Am]hurch[F]{\h}
I passed a[G]long the [E]way
Well I g[F]ot down [G]on my [C]knees (got down [E]on my [Am]knees)
And I pre[F]tend to [E]pray (I pretend to pray)
You know the preacher likes the [Am]cold   (preacher likes the c[F]old)
He knows I'm g[G]onna [E]stay (knows I'm gonna stay)

\gSec{Chorus}
California [Am]dreamin' (California   d[F]reamin')
On [G]such a winter's d[E]ay

All the leaves are [Am]brown  (all the leaves are [F]brown)
And the [G]sky is g[E]ray (and the sky is gray)
I[F]'ve been for a w[C]alk  (I've been [E]for a [Am]walk)
On a w[F]inter's [E]day (on a winter's day)
If I didn't [Am]tell her (if I didn't  [F]tell her)
I could l[G]eave tod[E]ay (I could leave today)
California [Am]dreamin'  (California    [F]dreamin')

On s[G]uch a winter's d[Am]ay (California  [F]dreamin')
On s[G]uch a winter's d[Am]ay (California  [F]dreamin')
On s[G]uch a winter's [F]day[Am]
