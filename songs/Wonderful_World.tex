\begin{song}[5]{What a Wonderful World}{Louis Armstrong}{}
I see t[C]rees of g[Em]reen, r[Am]ed roses t[Em]oo
[Dm]I see them [C]bloom, f[E]or me and y[Am]ou,
And I [F]think to mysel[Dm]f, What a w[G]onderful wo[C]rld.[G]{\hh}

I see [C]skies of [Em]blue and c[Am]louds of w[Em]hite,
[Dm]The bright blessed [C]day, the [E]dark sacred n[Am]ight,
And I [F]think to mysel[Dm]f, what a w[G]onderful wo[C]rld

The [G]colours of the rainbow, so[C] pretty in the sky,
[G]Are also on the faces of[C] people going by
I see fr[Am]iends shaking h[Em]ands saying [Am]how do you [Em]do
[F]Theyâ€™re really[Em] sayin[Dm]g I l[C]ove [G]you.

I hear [C]babies [Em]crying, I [F]watch them g[Em]row
[Dm]They'll learn mu[C]ch more than I[E]'ll ever k[Am]now,
And I [G#]think to myself,[Dm] what a won[G]derful worl[C]d[B]{\hh}[A]{\hh}

Yes I [F]think to myself,[Dm] what a wo[G]nderful wor[C]ld.
