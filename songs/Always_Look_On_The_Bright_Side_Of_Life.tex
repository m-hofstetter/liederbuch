\begin{song}{Always Look on the Bright Side of Life}{Monty Python}{}        
Some [Am]things in life are bad, they can r[G]eally make you [Em7]mad
Other [Am]things just make you swear and c[G]urse[Em7]{\h}      
When you're [Am]chewing on life's gristle
Don't [G]grumble, give a [E7]whistle
And [A7]this'll help things turn out for the [D7]best
 
\gSec{Chorus}
And [G]always [Em7]look on the [Am]bright [D7]side of [G]life[Em7]{\h}[Am]{\h}[D7]{\h}
Alw[G]ays [Em7]look on the [Am]light [D7]side of [G]life[Em7]{\h}[Am]{\h}[D7]{\h}
 
If [Am]life seems jolly rotten, there's so[G]mething you've fo[Em7]rgotten
and t[Am]hat's to laugh and smile and dance and [G]sing.[Em7]{\hspace{12mm}}
When you're [Am]feeling in the dumps, d[G]on't be silly [E7]chumps
Just [A7]purse your lips and whistle - that's the [D7]thing
 
\gSec{Chorus}
And [G]always [Em7]look on the [Am]bright [D7]side of [G]life[Em7]{\h}[Am]{\h}[D7]{\h}
Come on, al[G]ways [Em7]look on the [Am]bright [D7]side of l[G]ife[Em7]{\h}[Am]{\h}[D7]{\h}
 
For l[Am]ife is quite absurd and d[G]eath's the final [Em7]word
You must [Am]always face the curtain with a [G]bow[Em7]{\h}    
For[Am]get about your sin - give the [G]audience a [Em7]grin
Enj[A7]oy it - it's your last chance any[D7]how.
 
\gSec{Chorus}
So a[G]lways l[Em7]ook on the b[Am]right s[D7]ide of d[G]eath[Em7]{\h}[Am]{\h}[D7]{\h}
[G]Just be[Em7]fore you d[Am]raw your t[D7]erminal b[G]reath[Em7]{\h}[Am]{\h}[D7]{\h}

[Am]Life's a piece of shit   w[G]hen you look at [Em7]it
[Am]Life's a laugh and death's a joke, it's t[G]rue[Em7]{\h}
You'll [Am]see it's all a show,
keep 'em [G]laughing as you [E7]go
Just re[A7]member that the last laugh is on [D7]you

\gSec{Chorus}
And [G]always [Em7]look on the [Am]bright [D7]side of [G]life[Em7]{\h}[Am]{\h}[D7]{\h}
[G]Always [Em7]look on the [Am]right [D7]side of [G]life[Em7]{\h}[Am]{\h}[D7]{\h}
\sprache{Come on guys, cheer up!}
[A]Always look on the [Bm]bright [E7]side of [A]life[Bm]{\h}[E7]{\h}
[A]Always look on the [Bm]right [E7]side of [A]life[Bm]{\h}[E7]{\h}
