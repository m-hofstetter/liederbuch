\begin{song}[1]{Cats in the Cradle}{Harry Chapin}{}
My [E]child arrived just the [G]other day
He [A]came to the world in the [E]usual way
But there were planes to catch and [G]bills to pay
He [A]learned to walk while I [E]was away
And he was [D]talkin' 'fore I [A]knew it, and [Bm]as he [A]grew
He'd say ``I'm [G]gonna [Bm]be like [E]you dad
You [G]know I'm gonna [Bm]be like [E]you''

\gSec{Chorus}
And the [E]cat's in the cradle and the [D]silver spoon
[G]Little boy blue and the [A]man on the moon
[E]When you comin' home dad?
I [D]don't know when, but [G]we'll get to[Bm]gether [E]then son
You [G]know we'll have a [Bm]good time [E]then

My [E]son turned ten just the [G]other day
He said, ``[A]Thanks for the ball, Dad, [E]come on let's play
Can you teach me to throw'', I said ``[G]Not today
I [A]got a lot to do'', he said, ``[E]That's ok''
And he [D]walked a[A]way but his [Bm]smile never [A]dimmed
And said, ``I'm [G]gonna [Bm]be like [E]him, yeah
You [G]know I'm gonna [Bm]be like [E]him''

\gSec{Chorus}
And the [E]cat's in the cradle and the [D]silver spoon
[G]Little boy blue and the [A]man on the moon
[E]When you comin' home dad?
I [D]don't know when, but [G]we'll get to[Bm]gether [E]then son
You [G]know we'll have a [Bm]good time [E]then

Well, he [E]came home from college just the [G]other day
[A]So much like a man I just [E]had to say
``Son, I'm proud of you, can you [G]sit for a while?''
He [A]shook his head and [E]said with a smile
``What I'd [D]really like, [A]Dad, is to [Bm]borrow the car [A]keys
[G]See you later, can I [E]have them please?''

\gSec{Chorus}
And the [E]cat's in the cradle and the [D]silver spoon
[G]Little boy blue and the [A]man on the moon
[E]When you comin' home son?
I [D]don't know when, but [G]we'll get to[Bm]gether [E]then
You [G]know we'll have a [Bm]good time [E]then\pagebreak

I've [E]long since retired, my [G]son's moved away
I [A]called him up just the [E]other day
I said, ``I'd like to see you if [G]you don't mind''
He said, ``I'd [A]love to, Dad, if I can [E]find the time
You see my [D]new job's a [A]hassle and [Bm]kids have the [A]flu
But it's [G]sure nice [Bm]talking to [E]you, Dad
It's been [G]sure nice [Bm]talking to [E]you''

And [D]as I hung up the [A]phone it oc[Bm]curred to [A]me
He'd [G]grown up [Bm]just like [E]me
My [G]boy was [Bm]just like [E]me

\gSec{Chorus}
And the [E]cat's in the cradle and the [D]silver spoon
[G]Little boy blue and the [A]man on the moon
[E]When you comin' home son?
I [D]don't know when, but [G]we'll get to[Bm]gether [E]then
You [G]know we'll have a [Bm]good time [E]then
