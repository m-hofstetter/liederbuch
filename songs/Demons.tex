\begin{song}[3]{Demons}{Imagine Dragons}{}
When the da[C]ys are cold and the car[G]ds all fold
And the sai[Am]nts we see are all ma[F]de of gold
When your d[C]reams all fail and the one[G]s we hail 
Are the wor[Am]st of all and the bl[F]ood's run stale [C]{\h}

I want to hide the [G]truth, I want to shelter [Am]you
But with the beast [F]inside, there's nowhere we can [C]hide
No matter what we [G]breed, we still are made of [Am]greed
This is my kingdom [F]come, this is my kingdom [C]come

\gSec{Chorus}
When you feel my [G]heat, look into my [Am]eyes
It's where my demons [F]hide, it's where my demons [C]hide
Don't get too [G]close, it's dark in[Am]side
It's where my demons [F]hide, it's where my demons [C]hide

When the cu[C]rtain's call, is the last[G] of all
When the li[Am]ghts fade out, all the si[F]nners crawl
So they du[C]g your grave and the mas[G]querade
Will come c[Am]alling out at the mes[F]s you made

Don't want to let you [G]down, but I am hell [Am]bound
Though this is all for [F]you, don't want to hide the [C]truth
No matter what we [G]breed, we still are made of [Am]greed
This is my kingdom [F]come, this is my kingdom [C]come

\gSec{Chorus}
When you feel my [G]heat, look into my [Am]eyes
It's where my demons [F]hide, it's where my demons [C]hide
Don't get too [G]close, it's dark in[Am]side
It's where my demons [F]hide, it's where my demons [C]hide

They say it's what you [G]make, I say it's up to [Am]fate
It's woven in my [F]soul, I need to let you [C]go
Your eyes they shine so [G]bright, I want to save that [Am]light
I can't escape this [F]now, unless you show me [C]how

\gSec{Chorus}
When you feel my [G]heat, look into my [Am]eyes
It's where my demons [F]hide, it's where my demons [C]hide
Don't get too [G]close, it's dark in[Am]side
It's where my demons [F]hide, it's where my demons [C]hide
