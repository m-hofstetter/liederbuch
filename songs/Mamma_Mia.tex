\begin{song}{Mamma Mia}{ABBA}{}
[D]I've been c[A]heated by [D]you, since I don't know [G]when
[D]So I m[A]ade up my [D]mind, it must come to an [G]end
[D]Look at me now, [Daug]will I ever learn?
[D]I don't know ho[Daug]w, but I suddenly [G]lose control
There's a fire with[A]in my soul

[G]Just o[D]ne  [A]look and I can hear a bell ring, [G]one m[D]ore [A]look and I forget everything

\gSec{Chorus}
[D]Mamma mia, here I go again, [C]my [G]my, how can I res[D]ist you?
[D]Mamma mia, does it show again? [C]My [G]my, just how much I've m[D]issed you

[D]Yes, I've been b[A]rokenhearted
[Bm]Blue since the d[F#m]ay we parted
[C]Why, [G]why [Em]did I ever [A]let you go?
[D]Mamma mia,[Bm] now I really know,
[C]My   [G]my, [Em]I could never [A]let you go

[D]I've been a[A]ngry and [D]sad about the things that you [G]do
[D]I can't c[A]ount all the [D]times that I've told you we're [G]through
[D]And when you go,[Daug] when you slam the door
[D]I think you kno[Daug]w, that you won't be a[G]way too long
You know that I'm [A]not that strong

[G]Just o[D]ne  [A]look and I can hear a bell ring, [G]one m[D]ore [A]look and I forget everything

\gSec{Chorus}
[D]Mamma mia, here I go again, [C]my [G]my, how can I res[D]ist you?
[D]Mamma mia, does it show again? [C]My [G]my, just how much I've m[D]issed you

[D]Yes, I've been b[A]rokenhearted
[Bm]Blue since the d[F#m]ay we parted
[C]Why, [G]why [Em]did I ever [A]let you go?

\gSec{Chorus}
[D]Mamma mia, even if I say ``[C]Bye [G]bye, leave me now or n[D]ever''
[D]Mamma mia, it's a game we play, [C]bye [G]bye doesn't mean fore[D]ver
[D]Mamma mia, here I go again, [C]my [G]my, how can I res[D]ist you?
[D]Mamma mia, does it show again? [C]My [G]my, just how much I've m[D]issed you

[D]Yes, I've been b[A]rokenhearted
[Bm]Blue since the d[F#m]ay we parted
[C]Why, [G]why [Em]did I ever [A]let you go?
[D]Mamma mia,[Bm] now I really know,
[C]My   [G]my, [Em]I could never [A]let you go
