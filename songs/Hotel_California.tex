[Am]On a dark desert highway, [E7]cool wind in my hair
[G]Warm smell of colitas [D]rising up through the air
[F]Up ahead in the distance, [C]I saw a shimmering light
[Dm]My head grew heavy and my sight grew dim,
[E]I had to stop for the night

[Am]There she stood in the doorway, [E7]I heard the mission bell
[G]And I was thinking to myself
This could be [D]heaven or this could be hell
[F]Then she lit up a candle, [C]and she showed me the way
[Dm]There were voices down the corridor,
[E7]I thought I heard them say...

\gSec{Chorus}
[F]Welcome to the Hotel Cali[C]fornia
Such a [E7]lovely place (such a lovely place), such a [Am]lovely face
[F]There's plenty of room at the Hotel Cali[C]fornia
Any [Dm]time of year, (any time of year) You can [E7]find it here...

[Am]Her mind is Tiffany twisted, [E7]She got the Mercedes bends
[G]She got a lot of pretty pretty boys [D]that she calls friends
[F]How they danced in the courtyard, [C]sweet summer sweat
[Dm]Some dance to remember, [E7]some dance to forget

[Am]So I called up the captain; ``[E7]Please bring me my wine'' 
He said, [G]``We haven't had that spirit here since[D] 1969''
[F]And still those voices are calling from [C]far away
[Dm]Wake you up in the middle of the night
[E7]Just to hear them say...\pagebreak

\gSec{Chorus}
[F]Welcome to the Hotel Cali[C]fornia
Such a [E7]lovely place (such a lovely place), such a [Am]lovely face
They're [F]livin' it up at the Hotel Cali[C]fornia
What a [Dm]nice surprise (what a nice surprise), bring your [E7]alibis

[Am]Mirrors on the ceiling, [E7]the pink champagne on ice 
And she said, ``[G]We are all just prisoners here, [D]of our own device''
[F]And in the master's chambers, [C]they gathered for the feast
[Dm]They stab it with their steely knives, but they
[E7]Just can't kill the beast

[Am]Last thing I remember, I was [E7]running for the door
[G]I had to find the passage back to the [D]place I was before
[F]``Relax'' said the night man, ``we are [C]programmed to receive,
[Dm]You can check out any time you like
[E7]But you can never leave''
