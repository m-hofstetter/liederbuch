[C]Somewhere [Em]over the rainbow,[F]  way up [C]high
[F]and the [C]dreams that you dream of [G]once in a lull[Am]aby. [F]Ohhhh.

[C]Somewhere [Em]over the rainbow [F]bluebirds [C]fly
[F]and the [C]dreams that you dream of, [G]dreams really do come [Am]true. [F]Ohhhh.

Some[C]day I'll wish upon a star,
[Em]wake up where the clouds are far be[Am]hind [F]me.
Where [C]troubles melts like lemon drops,
[Em]high above the chimney tops,
that's [Am]where you'll [F]find me, oh

[C]Somewhere [Em]over the rainbow,[F]  bluebirds [C]fly
[F]and the [C]dreams that you dare to, oh, [G]why, oh why can't[Am]{ I?} I[F]-I-I, oh

Some[C]day I'll wish upon a star,
[Em]wake up where the clouds are far be[Am]hind [F]me-e-e.
Where [C]troubles melts like lemon drops,
[Em]high above the chimney tops
that's [Am]where you'll [F]find me, oh

[C]Somewhere [Em]over the rainbow,[F]  way up [C]high
[F]and the [C]dreams that you dare to, [G]why, oh why can't[Am]{ I?} I[F]-I-I
