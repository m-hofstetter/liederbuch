\begin{song}{American Pie}{Don McLean}{}
A [G]long, [D]long tim[Em]e ago
[Am]I can still re[C]member how that mus[Em]ic used to make me s[D]mile
And [G]I knew [D]if I ha[Em]d my chance
That [Am]I could make those [C]people dance and [Em]maybe they'd be [C]happy for a w[D]hile
But [Em]February [Am]made me shiver, [Em]with every paper I'[Am]d deliver
[C]Bad news [G]on the [Am]doorstep, I cou[C]ldn't take one more st[D]ep
I [G]can't remem[D]ber if I [Em]cried when I [Am]read about his [D]widowed bride
[G]Something [D]touched me [Em]deep inside
The [C]day the[D] music d[G]ied

\gSec{Chorus}
So [G]bye, [C]bye Miss [G]American [D]Pie
Drove my [G]Chevy to the [C]levy but the [G]levy was [D]dry
And them [G]good old [C]boys were drinkin' [G]whiskey and [D]rye
Singin' [Em]this will be the day that I [A]die, t[Em]his will be the day that I d[D]ie

[G]Did you write the [Am]book of love
And do [C]you have faith in [Am]God above, [Em]if the bible [D]tells you so?
[G]Do you [D]believe in r[Em]ock and roll
Can [Am]music save your[C] mortal soul an[Em]d can you teach me [A]how to dance [D]real slow?
Well I [Em]know that you're in l[D]ove with him 'cuz I s[Em]aw you dancin' i[D]n the gym
You [C]both kicked [G]off your [Am]shoes, man I [C]dig those rhythm and [D]blues
I was a [G]lonely [D]teenage b[Em]ronckin' buck with a [Am]pink carnation and a [C]pickup truck
But [G]I knew[D] I was o[Em]ut of luck the d[C]ay the m[D]usic d[G]ied[C],  
[G]I started [D]singin'

\gSec{Chorus}
[G]Bye, [C]bye Miss [G]American [D]Pie
Drove my [G]Chevy to the [C]levy but the [G]levy was [D]dry
And them [G]good old [C]boys were drinkin' [G]whiskey and [D]rye
Singin' [Em]this will be the day that I [A]die, t[Em]his will be the day that I d[D]ie

Now for t[G]en years we've been [Am]on our own
and mo[C]ss grows fat on a ro[Am]lling stone [Em]but that's not how it u[D]sed to be
When the j[G]ester [D]sang for the kin[Em]g and queen
in a [Am]coat he borrowed fr[C]om James Dean in a v[Em]oice that came [A]from you and[D] me
Oh, and w[Em]hile the king was lo[D]oking down, the j[Em]ester stole his thor[D]ny crown
The c[C]ourtroom [G]was ad[A]journed, [C]no verdict was re[D]turned
And while [G]Lennin rea[D]d a bo[Em]ok on Marx, the[Am] quartet prac[C]ticed in the park
And [G]we sang [D]dirges [Em]in the dark the d[C]ay the m[D]usic d[G]ied[C],  
[G]We were [D]singin'\pagebreak

\gSec{Chorus}
[G]Bye, [C]bye Miss [G]American [D]Pie
Drove my [G]Chevy to the [C]levy but the [G]levy was [D]dry
And them [G]good old [C]boys were drinkin' [G]whiskey and [D]rye
Singin' [Em]this will be the day that I [A]die, t[Em]his will be the day that I d[D]ie

[G]Helter skelter in a [Am]summer swelter
[C]the birds flew off with[Am] a fallout shelter,[Em] eight miles high and f[D]allin' fast
It lan[G]ded [D]foul o[Em]n the grass
the pl[Am]ayers tried for a f[C]orward pass, [Em]with the jester on the sideline[A]s in a [D]cast
Now the h[Em]alf-time air was s[D]weet perfume, while [Em]sergeants played a m[D]arching tune
[C]We all got [G]up to dan[A]ce, but [C]we never got the ch[D]ance
'Cuz the p[G]layers [D]tried to t[Em]ake the field, the [Am]marching band re[Cm]fused to yield
Do y[G]ou re[D]call what w[Em]as revealed the d[C]ay the m[D]usic d[G]ied[C],  
[G]We started [D]singin'

\gSec{Chorus}
[G]Bye, [C]bye Miss [G]American [D]Pie
Drove my [G]Chevy to the [C]levy but the [G]levy was [D]dry
And them [G]good old [C]boys were drinkin' [G]whiskey and [D]rye
Singin' [Em]this will be the day that I [A]die, t[Em]his will be the day that I d[D]ie

And t[G]here we were all [Am]in one place
a ge[C]neration [Am]lost in space,[Em] with no time left to[D] start again
So come on J[G]ack be [D]nimble,[Em] Jack be quick, J[Am]ack Flash sat on a c[C]andle
stick, [Em]'cuz fire is the devi[A]l's only friend[D]
And a[Em]s I watched him o[D]n the stage, 
my h[Em]ands were clenched in f[D]ists of rage
No [C]angel b[G]orn in [A]Hell could [C]break that Satan's [D]spell
And as the [G]flames climbe[D]d high int[Em]o the night to [Am]light the sacrif[C]icial rite
I saw [G]Satan [D]laughing [Em]with delight the d[C]ay the m[D]usic d[G]ied[C],  
[G]He was [D]singin'

\gSec{Chorus}
[G]Bye, [C]bye Miss [G]American [D]Pie
Drove my [G]Chevy to the [C]levy but the [G]levy was [D]dry
And them [G]good old [C]boys were drinkin' [G]whiskey and [D]rye
Singin' [Em]this will be the day that I [A]die, t[Em]his will be the day that I d[D]ie\pagebreak

I [G]met a[D] girl who s[Em]ang the blues
And I [Am]asked her for some [C]happy news, but [Em]she just smiled and turn[D]ed away
I [G]went dow[D]n to the s[Em]acred store
Where I[Am]'d heard the mus[C]ic years before, but t[Em]he man there said t[C]he music wouldn't [D]play
But [Em]in the streets the [Am]children screamed, the [Em]lovers cried and the [Am]poets dreamed
But [C]not a [G]word was [Am]spoken, the [C]church bells all were [D]broken
And the [G]three me[D]n I adm[Em]ire most, the [Am]Father, [C]Son, and the H[D]oly Ghost
[G]They caught th[D]e last train f[Em]or the coast the [C]day the [D]music [G]died,
[N.C.]And they were singin'

\gSec{Chorus}
[G]Bye, [C]bye Miss [G]American [D]Pie
Drove my [G]Chevy to the [C]levy but the [G]levy was [D]dry
And them [G]good old [C]boys were drinkin' [G]whiskey and [D]rye
Singin' [Em]this will be the day that I [A]die, t[Em]his will be the day that I d[D]ie
They were singin' [G]bye, [C]bye Miss [G]American [D]Pie
Drove my [G]Chevy to the [C]levy but the [G]levy was [D]dry
And them [G]good old [C]boys were drinkin' [G]whiskey and [D]rye
Singin' [C]this will be the [D]day that I [G]die[C]{\hh}[G]{\hh}
