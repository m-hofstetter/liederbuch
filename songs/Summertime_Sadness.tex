\begin{song}[4]{Summertime Sadness}{Lana Del Rey}{}\gSec{Chorus}
[F]Kiss me hard before you [Am]go - [G]Summertime sadne[Dm]ss
[F]I just wanted you to k[Am]now, that b[G]aby you're the b[Dm]est

I got my r[F]ed dress on toni[Am]ght
Dancing in the d[G]ark in the pale moonli[Dm]ght
Done my hair up r[F]eal big beauty queen st[Am]yle
High heels o[G]ff, I'm feeling ali[Dm]ve

[F]Oh, my God, I f[Am]eel it in the air
Telephone [G]wires above are [Dm]sizzlin' like a snare
Honey I[F]'m on fire, I f[Am]eel it everywhere
Nothing s[G]cares me anym[Dm]ore

\gSec{Chorus}
[F]Kiss me hard before you [Am]go - [G]Summertime sadne[Dm]ss
[F]I just wanted you to k[Am]now, that b[G]aby you're the b[Dm]est

[F]I've got that summertime, [Am]summertime sadness
[G]S-s-summertime, [Dm]summertime sadness
[F]Got that summertime, [Am]summertime sadness[G]{\hh}[Dm]{\hh}

I'm feelin' [F]electric toni[Am]ght
Cruising down the c[G]oast goin' 'bout 9[Dm]9
Got my bad b[F]aby by my heavenly s[Am]ide
I know if I g[G]o, I'll die happy ton[Dm]ight

[F]Oh, my God, I f[Am]eel it in the air
Telephone [G]wires above are [Dm]sizzlin' like a snare
Honey I[F]'m on fire, I f[Am]eel it everywhere
Nothing s[G]cares me anym[Dm]ore

\gSec{Chorus}
[F]Kiss me hard before you [Am]go - [G]Summertime sadne[Dm]ss
[F]I just wanted you to k[Am]now, that b[G]aby you're the b[Dm]est

[F]I've got that summertime, [Am]summertime sadness
[G]S-s-summertime, [Dm]summertime sadness
[F]Got that summertime, [Am]summertime sadness{\hh}[Dm]{\hh}

\gSec{Chorus}
[F]Kiss me hard before you [Am]go - [G]Summertime sadne[Dm]ss
[F]I just wanted you to k[Am]now, that b[G]aby you're the b[Dm]est
