It's not t[G]ime to make a ch[D]ange, just rel[C]ax, take it [Am7]easy,
You're still yo[G]ung, that's your f[Em]ault, there's so m[Am]uch you have to kn[D]ow,
Find a g[G]irl, settle do[D]wn, if you w[C]ant, you can m[Am7]arry,
Look at [G]me, I am o[Em]ld, but I'm h[Am7]appy[D]{\h}
I was on[G]ce like you are [Bm7]now, and I kn[C]ow that it's not e[Am7]asy to be ca[G]lm,
When you've fo[Em]und something going [Am7]on, \hh [D]but take your t[G]ime, think a [Bm7]lot,
Why, think of ever[C]ything you've [Am7]got, for you will st[G]ill be here tomo[Em]rrow,
But your dre[D]ams may n[G]ot[C/G]{\h}[G]{\h}[C/G]{\h}

How can [G]I try to ex-pl[Bm7]ain? When I [C]do , he turns a-[Am7]way again!
It's al[G]ways been the same,[Em]   the same old s[Am7]tory,[D]{\h}
From the mom[G]ent I could t[Bm7]alk, I was ord[C]ered to li[Am7]sten,
Now there's a w[G]ay, and I k[Em]now that I ha[D]ve to [G]go away,
I kn[D]ow I h[C]ave to [G]go[C/G]{\h}[G]{\h}[C/G]{\h}

It's not t[G]ime to make a c[D]hange, just sit d[C]own, take it sl[Am7]owly,
You're still yo[G]ung, that's you're f[Em]ault there's so m[Am]uch
you have to [D]go through, Find a g[G]irl,settle d[D]own, if you w[C]ant you can ma[Am7]rry,
Look at m[G]e, I am o[Em]ld, but I'm h[Am7]appy[D]{\h}

All the ti[G]mes that I c[Bm7]ried, keeping a[C]ll the things I [Am7]knew inside,
It's ha[G]rd, but it's ha[Em]rder to ig-n[Am7]ore it![D]{\h}
If they were ri[G]ght, I'd a-g[Bm7]ree, but it's t[C]hem, they know, not [Am7]me,
Now there's a w[G]ay, and I k[Em]now that I ha[D]ve to g[G]o away, I k[D]now I h[C]ave to [G]go
